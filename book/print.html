<p>Hi! This is a little side project where i will re-document the famous "The C Programming Language" book while studying its contents.</p>
<p>It will be a work in progress, and at the end i will add the solutions for the challenges given in the book.</p>
<p>To undertake this task, i am using <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/">mdBook</a> (whose result you are reading at this very moment) and part of the conversion from the PDF of the book to Markdown is done using <a href="https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker">Marker</a>.</p>
<p>I know this seems like a lot of content, and it definitely is. So i suggest taking your time to understand what you read, pausing and exploring deeper where needed.</p>
<p>An important part of programming is balancing learning with doing. Spending all your time learning means you don't do or make anything. Spending all your time making means you might not progress in a meaningful way.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="preface"><a class="header" href="#preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>The computing world has undergone a revolution since the publication of The C Programming Language in 1978. Big computers are much bigger, and personal computers have capabilities that rival mainframes of a decade ago. During this time, C has changed too, although only modestly, and it has spread far beyond its origins as the language of the UNIX operating system.</p>
<p>The growing popularity of C, the changes in the language over the years, and the creation of compilers by groups not involved in its design, combined to demonstrate a need for a more precise and more contemporary definition of the language than the first edition of this book provided. In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee whose goal was to produce “an unambiguous and machine-independent definition of the language C”, while still retaining its spirit. The result is the ANSI standard for C.</p>
<p>The standard formalizes constructions that were hinted but not described in the first edition, particularly structure assignment and enumerations. It provides a new form of function declaration that permits cross-checking of definition with use. It specifies a standard library, with an extensive set of functions for performing input and output, memory management, string manipulation, and similar tasks. It makes precise the behavior of features that were not spelled out in the original definition, and at the same time states explicitly which aspects of the language remain machine-dependent.</p>
<p>This Second Edition of The C Programming Language describes C as defined by the ANSI standard. Although we have noted the places where the language has evolved, we have chosen to write exclusively in the new form. For the most part, this makes no significant difference; the most visible change is the new form of function declaration and definition. Modern compilers already support most features of the standard.</p>
<p>We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.</p>
<p>Appendix A, the reference manual, is not the standard, but our attempt to convey the essentials of the standard in a smaller space. It is meant for easy comprehension by programmers, but not as a definition for compiler writers – that role properly belongs to the standard itself. Appendix B is a summary of the facilities of the standard library. It too is meant for reference by programmers, not implementers. Appendix C is a concise summary of the changes from the original version.</p>
<p>As we said in the preface to the first edition, C “wears well as one’s experience with it grows”. With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you learn C and use it well.</p>
<p>We are deeply indebted to friends who helped us to produce this second edition. Jon Bently, Doug Gwyn, Doug McIlroy, Peter Nelson, and Rob Pike gave us perceptive comments on almost every page of draft manuscripts. We are grateful for careful reading by Al Aho, Dennis Allison, Joe Campbell, G.R. Emlin, Karen Fortgang, Allen Holub, Andrew Hume, Dave Kristol, John Linderman, Dave Prosser, Gene Spafford, and Chris van Wyk. We also received helpful suggestions from Bill Cheswick, Mark Kernighan, Andy Koenig, Robin Lake, Tom London, Jim Reeds, Clovis Tondo, and Peter Weinberger. Dave Prosser answered many detailed questions about the ANSI standard. We used Bjarne Stroustrup’s C++ translator extensively for local testing of our programs, and Dave Kristol provided us with an ANSI C compiler for final testing. Rich Drechsler helped greatly with typesetting.</p>
<p>Our sincere thanks to all.</p>

<p>C is a general-purpose programming language with features economy of expression, modern flow control and data structures, and a rich set of operators. C is not a very high level'' language, nor abig'‘ one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.</p>
<p>C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie. The operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs (including all of the software used to prepare this book) are written in C. Production compilers also exist for several other machines, including the IBM System/370, the Honeywell 6000, and the Interdata 8/32. C is not tied to any particular hardware or system, however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any machine that supports C.</p>
<p>This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. It contains a tutorial introduction to get new users started as soon as possible, separate chapters on each major feature, and a reference manual. Most of the treatment is based on reading, writing and revising examples, rather than on mere statements of rules. For the most part, the examples are complete, real programs rather than isolated fragments. All examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form. Besides showing how to make effective use of the language, we have also tried where possible to illustrate useful algorithms and principles of good style and sound design.</p>
<p>The book is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to more knowledgeable colleague will help.</p>
<p>In our experience, C has proven to be a pleasant, expressive and versatile language for a wide variety of programs. It is easy to learn, and it wears well as on’s experience with it grows. We hope that this book will help you to use it well.</p>
<p>The thoughtful criticisms and suggestions of many friends and colleagues have added greatly to this book and to our pleasure in writing it. In particular, Mike Bianchi, Jim Blue, Stu Feldman, Doug McIlroy Bill Roome, Bob Rosin and Larry Rosler all read multiple volumes with care. We are also indebted to Al Aho, Steve Bourne, Dan Dvorak, Chuck Haley, Debbie Haley, Marion Harris, Rick Holt, Steve Johnson, John Mashey, Bob Mitze, Ralph Muha, Peter Nelson, Elliot Pinson, Bill Plauger, Jerry Spivack, Ken Thompson, and Peter Weinberger for helpful comments at various stages, and to Mile Lesk and Joe Ossanna for invaluable assistance with typesetting.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-1---a-tutorial-introduction"><a class="header" href="#chapter-1---a-tutorial-introduction">Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Let us begin with a quick introduction in C. Our aim is to show the essential elements of the language in real programs, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions. At this point, we are not trying to be complete or even precise (save that the examples are meant to be correct). We want to get you as quickly as possible to the point where you can write useful programs, and to do that we have to concentrate on the basics: variables and constants, arithmetic, control flow, functions, and the rudiments of input and output. We are intentionally leaving out of this chapter features of C that are important for writing bigger programs. These include pointers, structures, most of C’s rich set of operators, several controlflow statements, and the standard library.</p>
<p>This approach and its drawbacks. Most notable is that the complete story on any particular feature is not found here, and the tutorial, by being brief, may also be misleading. And because the examples do not use the full power of C, they are not as concise and elegant as they might be. We have tried to minimize these effects, but be warned. Another drawback is that later chapters will necessarily repeat some of this chapter. We hope that the repetition will help you more than it annoys.</p>
<p>In any case, experienced programmers should be able to extrapolate from the material in this chapter to their own programming needs. Beginners should supplement it by writing small, similar programs of their own. Both groups can use it as a framework on which to hang the more detailed descriptions that begin in Chapter 2.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="getting-started"><a class="header" href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h1>
<p>The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages, print the words:</p>
<p>"<em>hello, world</em>"</p>
<p>This is a big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. With these mechanical details mastered, everything else is comparatively easy.</p>
<p>In C, the program to print "<em>hello, world</em>" is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 int main(){ 
    printf("hello, world\n"); 
    return 0;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ".c", such as "hello.c", then compile it with the command:</p>
<pre><code>cc hello.c
</code></pre>
<p>If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently, and make an executable file called "a.out". If you run it by typing the command:</p>
<pre><code>a.out 
</code></pre>
<p>it will print:</p>
<pre><code>hello, world
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note for modern workflow (MacOS)</strong><br />
running the executable requires a "./" before the name, so that would be:
<code>./a.out</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, for some explanations about the program itself. A C program, whatever its size, consists of <em>functions</em> and <em>variables</em>. A function contains <em>statements</em> that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. C functions are like the subroutines and functions in Fortran or the procedures and functions of Pascal. Our example is a function named "main". Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like, but "main" is special - your program begins executing at the beginning of main. This means that every program must have a main somewhere.</p>
<p>main will usually call other functions to help perform its job, some that you wrote, and others from libraries that are provided for you. The first line of the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library; the line appears at the beginning of many C source files. The standard library is described in <a href="Chapter1/">Chapter 7</a> and <a href="Chapter1/">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values, called <em>arguments</em>, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list. In this example, main is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list ( ).</p>
<hr />
<p style= "text-align: center;"><b> The first C program </b></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;                  *include information about the standard library  
int main(){                         *define a function called main that received no argument values  
    printf("hello, world\n");       *main calls library function "printf" to print this sequence of characters   
    return 0;                       *\n represents the newline character   
}                                   *statements of main are enclosed in braces
                                    
</code></pre>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note for modern C</strong><br />
The return statement in main returns a value to us to let us know if the program exited correctly. 0 means it ran without errors.<br />
While this statement is technically optional, (many compilers will interpret the lack of return as a 0 return)
it is smart and good discipline to add the return 0 explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statements of a function are enclosed in braces { }. The function main contains only one statement:</p>
<pre><code> printf("hello, world\n");
</code></pre>
<p>A function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments, so this calls the function printf with the argument "hello, world\n". printf is a library function that prints output, in this case the string of characters between the quotes.</p>
<p>A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a <em>character string</em> or <em>string constant</em>. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf and other functions.</p>
<p>The sequence \n in the string is C notation for the <em>newline character</em>, which when printed advances the output to the left margin on the next line. If you leave out the \n (a worthwhile experiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must use \n to include a newline character in the printf argument; if you try something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> printf("hello, world 
 "); 
</code></pre>
<p>the C compiler will produce an error message.<br />
printf never supplies a newline character automatically, so several calls may be used to build up an output line in stages. Our first program could just as well have been written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int main(){ 
    printf("hello, "); 
    printf("world"); 
    printf("\n"); 
 }
</code></pre>
<p>to produce identical output.</p>
<p>Notice that \n represents only a single character. An <em>escape sequence</em> like \n provides a general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among the others that C provides are \t for tab, \b for backspace, " for the double quote and \ for the backslash itself. There is a complete list in Section 2.3.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter1/"><strong>Exercise 1-1.</strong></a> Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter1/"><strong>Exercise 1-2.</strong></a> Experiment to find out what happens when prints's argument string contains <em>\c</em>, where <em>c</em> is some character not listed above.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables-and-arithmetic-expressions"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-arithmetic-expressions">Variables and Arithmetic Expressions</a></h1>
<p>The next program uses the formula <code>°C = (5 / 9) * (°F - 32)</code> to print the following table of Fahrenheit temperatures and their centigrade or Celsius equivalents:</p>
<pre><code>1 -17
20 -6
40 4
60 15
80 26
100 37
120 48
140 60
160 71
180 82
200 93
220 104
240 115
260 126
280 137
300 148
</code></pre>
<p>The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named main. It is longer than the one that printed "hello, world", but not complicated. It introduces several new ideas, including comments, declarations, variables, arithmetic expressions, loops, and formatted output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table

<p>In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the beginning of the function before any executable statements. A <em>declaration</em> announces the properties of variables; it consists of a name and a list of variables, such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> int fahr, celsius; 
 int lower, upper, step;
</code></pre>
<p>The type int means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with float, which means floating point, i.e., numbers that may have a fractional part. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are using; 16-bit ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit ints. A float number is typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10E-38 and 10E38.</p>
<p>C provides several other data types besides int and float, including:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Size</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>char</td><td>character - a single byte</td></tr>
<tr><td>short</td><td>short integer</td></tr>
<tr><td>long</td><td>long integer</td></tr>
<tr><td>double</td><td>double-precision floating point</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. There are also <em>arrays</em>, <em>structures</em> and <em>unions</em> of these basic types, <em>pointers</em> to them, and <em>functions</em> that return them, all of which we will meet in due course.</p>
<p>Computation in the temperature conversion program begins with the <em>assignment statements</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> lower = 0; 
 upper = 300; 
 step = 20;
</code></pre>
<p>which set the variables to their initial values. Individual statements are terminated by semicolons.</p>
<p>Each line of the table is computed the same way, so we use a loop that repeats once per output line; this is the purpose of the while loop</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> while (fahr &lt;= upper) { 
 ... 
 }
</code></pre>
<p>The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true (fahr is less than or equal to upper), the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed. Then the condition is re-tested, and if true, the body is executed again. When the test becomes false (fahr exceeds upper) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows the loop. There are no further statements in this program, so it terminates.</p>
<p>The body of a while can be one or more statements enclosed in braces, as in the temperature converter, or a single statement without braces, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> while (i &lt; j) 
    i = 2 * i;
</code></pre>
<p>In either case, we will always indent the statements controlled by the while by one tab stop (which we have shown as four spaces) so you can see at a glance which statements are inside the loop. The indentation emphasizes the logical structure of the program. Although C compilers do not care about how a program looks, proper indentation and spacing are critical in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. We have chosen one of several popular styles. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently.</p>
<p>Most of the work gets done in the body of the loop. The Celsius temperature is computed and assigned to the variable celsius by the statement</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">celsius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9;
</code></pre>
<p>The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 instead of just multiplying by 5/9 is that in C, as in many other languages, integer division <em>truncates</em>: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers. 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero.</p>
<p>This example also shows a bit more of how printf works. printf is a general-purpose output formatting function, which we will describe in detail in Chapter 7. Its first argument is a string of characters to be printed, with each % indicating where one of the other (second, third, ...) arguments is to be substituted, and in what form it is to be printed. For instance, %d specifies an integer argument, so the statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
</code></pre>
<p>causes the values of the two integers fahr and celsius to be printed, with a tab (\t) between them.</p>
<p>Each % construction in the first argument of printf is paired with the corresponding second argument, third argument, etc.; they must match up properly by number and type, or you will get wrong answers.</p>
<p>By the way, printf is not part of the C language; there is no input or output defined in C itself. printf is just a useful function from the standard library of functions that are normally accessible to C programs. The behaviour of printf is defined in the ANSI standard, however, so its properties should be the same with any compiler and library that conforms to the standard.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate on C itself, we don't talk much about input and output until <a href="Chapter1/">Chapter 7</a>. In particular, we will defer formatted input until then. If you have to input numbers, read the discussion of the function scanf in <a href="Chapter1/">Section 7.4</a>. scanf is like printf, except that it reads input instead of writing output.</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment each %d in the printf statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right-justified in their fields. For instance, we might say</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius); 
</code></pre>
<p>to print the first number of each line in a field three digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide, like this:</p>
<pre><code>  0    -17 
 20     -6 
 40      4 
 60     15 
 80     26 
100     37 
...
</code></pre>
<p>The more serious problem is that because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate; for instance, 0°F is actually about -17.8°C, not -17. To get more accurate answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program. Here is the second version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table 
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300; floating-point version */ 
int main() 
{ 
    float fahr, celsius; 
    float lower, upper, step; 
    lower = 0; /* lower limit of temperature scale */ 
    upper = 300; /* upper limit */ 
    step = 20; /* step size */ 
    fahr = lower; 
    while (fahr &lt;= upper) { 
          celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0); 
          printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius); 
          fahr = fahr + step; 
    } 
    return 0;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>This is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float and the formula for conversion is written in a more natural way. We were unable to use 5/9 in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, however, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values.</p>
<p>If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written (fahr-32), the 32 would be automatically converted to floating point. Nevertheless, writing floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral values emphasizes their floating-point nature for human readers.</p>
<p>The detailed rules for when integers are converted to floating point are in Chapter 2. For now, notice that the assignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">fahr = lower; 
</code></pre>
<p>And the test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">while (fahr &lt;= upper) 
</code></pre>
<p>Also work in the natural way - the int is converted to float before the operation is done.</p>
<p>The printf conversion specification %3.0f says that a floating-point number (here fahr) is to be printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits. %6.1f describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. The output looks like this:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>°C</th><th>°F</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>0</td><td>-17.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>-6.7</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>4.4</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Width and precision may be omitted from a specification: %6f says that the number is to be at least six characters wide; %.2f specifies two characters after the decimal point, but the width is not constrained; and %f merely says to print the number as floating point.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Character</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>%d</td><td>print as decimal integer</td></tr>
<tr><td>%6d</td><td>print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide</td></tr>
<tr><td>%f</td><td>print as floating point</td></tr>
<tr><td>%6f</td><td>print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide</td></tr>
<tr><td>%.2f</td><td>print as floating point, 2 characters after decimal point</td></tr>
<tr><td>%6.2f</td><td>print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Among others, printf also recognizes %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character string and %% for itself.</p>
