<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Welcome to my process of learning C through the famous book "The C Programming Language".
As i am reading, i will be adapting the book into a more web-friendly format.</p>
<p>To undertake this task, i am using</p>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/" target="_blank"> mdBook</a>
(whose result you are reading at this very moment) and part of the conversion from the PDF of the book to Markdown was done using
<a href="https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker" target="_blank"> Marker</a>.</p>
<p>At some point i might add a small intro to explain how to get started with C (basic text editor, compiler etc.). Since i feel like starting from the basics is never a bad idea. Using an IDE right at the start might be overkill for people who enjoy "intuitive learning".</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="preface"><a class="header" href="#preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>The computing world has undergone a revolution since the publication of "The C Programming Language" in 1978. Big computers are much bigger, and personal computers have capabilities that rival mainframes of a decade ago. During this time C has changed too, although only modestly, and it has spread far beyond its origins as the language of the UNIX operating system.</p>
<p>The growing popularity of C, the changes in the language over the years, and the creation of compilers by groups not involved in its design, combined to demonstrate a need for a more precise and more contemporary definition of the language than the first edition of this book provided. In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee whose goal was to produce “an unambiguous and machine-independent definition of the language C”, while still retaining its spirit. The result is the ANSI standard for C.</p>
<p>The standard formalizes constructions that were hinted but not described in the first edition, particularly structure assignment and enumerations. It provides a new form of function declaration that permits cross-checking of definition with use. It specifies a standard library, with an extensive set of functions for performing input and output, memory management, string manipulation, and similar tasks. It makes precise the behavior of features that were not spelled out in the original definition, and at the same time states explicitly which aspects of the language remain machine-dependent.</p>
<p>This second edition of "The C Programming Language" describes C as defined by the ANSI standard. Although we have noted the places where the language has evolved, we have chosen to write exclusively in the new form. For the most part, this makes no significant difference; the most visible change is the new form of function declaration and definition. Modern compilers already support most features of the standard.</p>
<p>We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.</p>
<p><a href="AppendixA/A1.html">Appendix A</a>, the reference manual, is not the standard, but our attempt to convey the essentials of the standard in a smaller space. It is meant for easy comprehension by programmers, but not as a definition for compiler writers – that role properly belongs to the standard itself. <a href="AppendixB/B0.html">Appendix B</a> is a summary of the facilities of the standard library. It too is meant for reference by programmers, not implementers. <a href="AppendixC.html">Appendix C</a> is a concise summary of the changes from the original version.</p>
<p>As we said in the preface to the first edition, C “wears well as one’s experience with it grows”. With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you learn C and use it well.</p>
<p>We are deeply indebted to friends who helped us to produce this second edition. Jon Bently, Doug Gwyn, Doug McIlroy, Peter Nelson, and Rob Pike gave us perceptive comments on almost every page of draft manuscripts. We are grateful for careful reading by Al Aho, Dennis Allison, Joe Campbell, G.R. Emlin, Karen Fortgang, Allen Holub, Andrew Hume, Dave Kristol, John Linderman, Dave Prosser, Gene Spafford, and Chris van Wyk. We also received helpful suggestions from Bill Cheswick, Mark Kernighan, Andy Koenig, Robin Lake, Tom London, Jim Reeds, Clovis Tondo, and Peter Weinberger. Dave Prosser answered many detailed questions about the ANSI standard. We used Bjarne Stroustrup’s C++ translator extensively for local testing of our programs, and Dave Kristol provided us with an ANSI C compiler for final testing. Rich Drechsler helped greatly with typesetting.</p>
<p>Our sincere thanks to all.</p>

<p>C is a general-purpose programming language which features economy of expression, modern flow control and data structures, and a rich set of operators. C is not a very "high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.</p>
<p>C was originally designed for, and implemented on, the UNIX operating system on the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie. The operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs (including all of the software used to prepare this book) are written in C. Production compilers also exist for several other machines, including the IBM System/370, the Honeywell 6000, and the Interdata 8/32. C is not tied to any particular hardware or system, however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any machine that supports C.</p>
<p>This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. It contains a tutorial introduction to get new users started as soon as possible, separate chapters on each major feature, and a reference manual. Most of the treatment is based on reading, writing and revising examples, rather than on mere statements of rules. For the most part, the examples are complete, real programs rather than isolated fragments. All examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form. Besides showing how to make effective use of the language, we have also tried where possible to illustrate useful algorithms and principles of good style and sound design.</p>
<p>The book is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to more knowledgeable colleague will help.</p>
<p>In our experience, C has proven to be a pleasant, expressive and versatile language for a wide variety of programs. It is easy to learn, and it wears well as on’s experience with it grows. We hope that this book will help you to use it well.</p>
<p>The thoughtful criticisms and suggestions of many friends and colleagues have added greatly to this book and to our pleasure in writing it. In particular, Mike Bianchi, Jim Blue, Stu Feldman, Doug McIlroy Bill Roome, Bob Rosin and Larry Rosler all read multiple volumes with care. We are also indebted to Al Aho, Steve Bourne, Dan Dvorak, Chuck Haley, Debbie Haley, Marion Harris, Rick Holt, Steve Johnson, John Mashey, Bob Mitze, Ralph Muha, Peter Nelson, Elliot Pinson, Bill Plauger, Jerry Spivack, Ken Thompson, and Peter Weinberger for helpful comments at various stages, and to Mile Lesk and Joe Ossanna for invaluable assistance with typesetting.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-1---a-tutorial-introduction"><a class="header" href="#chapter-1---a-tutorial-introduction">Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Let us begin with a quick introduction in C. Our aim is to show the essential elements of the language in real programs, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions. At this point, we are not trying to be complete or even precise (save that the examples are meant to be correct). We want to get you as quickly as possible to the point where you can write useful programs, and to do that we have to concentrate on the basics: variables and constants, arithmetic, control flow, functions, and the rudiments of input and output. We are intentionally leaving out of this chapter features of C that are important for writing bigger programs. These include pointers, structures, most of C’s rich set of operators, several control flow statements, and the standard library.</p>
<p>This approach has its drawbacks. Most notable is that the complete story on any particular feature is not found here, and the tutorial, by being brief, may also be misleading. And because the examples do not use the full power of C, they are not as concise and elegant as they might be. We have tried to minimize these effects, but be warned. Another drawback is that later chapters will necessarily repeat some of this chapter. We hope that the repetition will help you more than it annoys.</p>
<p>In any case, experienced programmers should be able to extrapolate from the material in this chapter to their own programming needs. Beginners should supplement it by writing small, similar programs of their own. Both groups can use it as a framework on which to hang the more detailed descriptions that begin in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter2/2-0.html">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="getting-started"><a class="header" href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h1>
<p>The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages, print the words:</p>
<p>"<em>hello, world</em>"</p>
<p>This is a big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. With these mechanical details mastered, everything else is comparatively easy.</p>
<p>In C, the program to print "<em>hello, world</em>" is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int main() { 

    printf("hello, world\n"); 
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ".c", such as "hello.c", then compile it with the command:</p>
<pre><code>cc hello.c
</code></pre>
<p>If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently, and make an executable file called "a.out". If you run it by typing the command:</p>
<pre><code>a.out 
</code></pre>
<p>it will print:</p>
<pre><code>hello, world
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note for modern workflow (MacOS)</strong><br />
running the executable requires a "./" before the name, so that would be:
<code>./a.out</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, for some explanations about the program itself. A C program, whatever its size, consists of <em>functions</em> and <em>variables</em>. A function contains <em>statements</em> that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. C functions are like the subroutines and functions in Fortran or the procedures and functions of Pascal. Our example is a function named <em>main</em>. Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like, but main is special - your program begins executing at the beginning of main. This means that every program must have a main somewhere.</p>
<p>main will usually call other functions to help perform its job, some that you wrote, and others from libraries that are provided for you. The first line of the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library; the line appears at the beginning of many C source files. The standard library is described in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter7/7-0.html">Chapter 7</a> and <a href="Chapter1/../AppendixB/B0.html">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values, called <em>arguments</em>, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list. In this example, main is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list: ().</p>
<hr />
<p style= "text-align: center;"><b> The first C program </b></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;                  *include information about the standard library  
int main() {                        *define a function called main that received no argument values  

    printf("hello, world\n");       *main calls library function "printf" to print this sequence of characters   
    return 0;                       *\n represents the newline character   
}                                   *statements of main are enclosed in braces                                 
</code></pre>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note for modern C</strong><br />
The return statement in main returns a value to us to let us know if the program exited correctly. 0 usually means it ran without errors.<br />
While this statement is technically optional, (many compilers will interpret the lack of return as a 0 return)
it is smart and good discipline to add the return 0 explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statements of a function are enclosed in braces: {}. The function main contains only one statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("hello, world\n");
</code></pre>
<p>A function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments, so this calls the function printf with the argument "hello, world\n". printf is a library function that prints output, in this case the string of characters between the quotes.</p>
<p>A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a <em>character string</em> or <em>string constant</em>. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf and other functions.</p>
<p>The sequence <code>\n</code> in the string is C notation for the <em>newline character</em>, which when printed advances the output to the left margin on the next line. If you leave out the <code>\n</code> (a worthwhile experiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must use <code>\n</code> to include a newline character in the printf argument; if you try something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("hello, world 
"); 
</code></pre>
<p>the C compiler will produce an error message.<br />
printf never supplies a newline character automatically, so several calls may be used to build up an output line in stages. Our first program could just as well have been written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int main() { 

    printf("hello, "); 
    printf("world"); 
    printf("\n"); 
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>to produce identical output.</p>
<p>Notice that <code>\n</code> represents only a single character. An <em>escape sequence</em> like <code>\n</code> provides a general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among the others that C provides are <code>\t</code> for tab, <code>\b</code> for backspace,<code>\"</code> for the double quote and <code>\\</code> for the backslash itself. There is a complete list in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter2/2-3.html">Section 2.3</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter1/../Solutions/Chapter1/E1-1.html"><strong>Exercise 1-1.</strong></a> Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter1/../Solutions/Chapter1/E1-2.html"><strong>Exercise 1-2.</strong></a> Experiment to find out what happens when prints's argument string contains <em>\c</em>, where <em>c</em> is some character not listed above.</p>

<p>The next program uses the formula <code>°C = (5 / 9) * (°F - 32)</code> to print the following table of Fahrenheit temperatures and their centigrade or Celsius equivalents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">1 -17

<p>The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named main. It is longer than the one that printed "hello, world", but not complicated. It introduces several new ideas, including comments, declarations, variables, arithmetic expressions, loops, and formatted output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table 
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */ 
int main() { 

     int fahr, celsius; 
     int lower, upper, step; 
     lower = 0; /* lower limit of temperature scale */ 
     upper = 300; /* upper limit */ 
     step = 20; /* step size */ 
     fahr = lower; 
     while (fahr &lt;= upper) { 
          celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9; 
          printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius); 
          fahr = fahr + step; 
     } 
     return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The two lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table 
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
</code></pre>
<p>are a <em>comment</em>, which in this case explains briefly what the program does. Any characters between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> are ignored by the compiler; they may be used freely to make a program easier to understand. Comments may appear anywhere where a blank, tab or newline can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note for modern C (since C99)</strong><br />
Comments on a single line can also be done by putting <code>//</code> in front of whatever text you want.
Doing so means the rest of the line will be ignored by the compiler:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// This is a single-line comment
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the beginning of the function before any executable statements. A <em>declaration</em> announces the properties of variables; it consists of a name and a list of variables, such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int fahr, celsius; 
int lower, upper, step;
</code></pre>
<p>The type <em>int</em> means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with <em>float</em>, which means floating point, i.e., numbers that may have a fractional part. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are using; 16-bit ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit ints. A float number is typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10E-38 and 10E38.</p>
<p>C provides several other data types besides int and float, including:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Identifier</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>char</td><td>character - a single byte</td></tr>
<tr><td>short</td><td>short integer</td></tr>
<tr><td>long</td><td>long integer</td></tr>
<tr><td>double</td><td>double-precision floating point</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. There are also <em>arrays</em>, <em>structures</em> and <em>unions</em> of these basic types, <em>pointers</em> to them, and <em>functions</em> that return them, all of which we will meet in due course.</p>
<p>Computation in the temperature conversion program begins with the assignment statements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">lower = 0; 
upper = 300; 
step = 20;
</code></pre>
<p>which set the variables to their initial values. Individual statements are terminated by semicolons.</p>
<p>Each line of the table is computed the same way, so we use a loop that repeats once per output line; this is the purpose of the while loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">while (fahr &lt;= upper) { 
    ... 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true (fahr is less than or equal to upper), the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed. Then the condition is re-tested, and if true, the body is executed again. When the test becomes false (fahr exceeds upper) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows the loop. There are no further statements in this program, so it terminates.</p>
<p>The body of a while can be one or more statements enclosed in braces, as in the temperature converter, or a single statement without braces, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">while (i &lt; j) 
    i = 2 * i;
</code></pre>
<p>In either case, we will always indent the statements controlled by the while by one tab stop (which we have shown as four spaces) so you can see at a glance which statements are inside the loop. The indentation emphasizes the logical structure of the program. Although C compilers do not care about how a program looks, proper indentation and spacing are critical in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. We have chosen one of several popular styles. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently.</p>
<p>Most of the work gets done in the body of the loop. The Celsius temperature is computed and assigned to the variable celsius by the statement</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">celsius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9;
</code></pre>
<p>The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 instead of just multiplying by 5/9 is that in C, as in many other languages, integer division <em>truncates</em>: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers. 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero.</p>
<p>This example also shows a bit more of how printf works. printf is a general-purpose output formatting function, which we will describe in detail in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter7/7-0.html">Chapter 7</a>. Its first argument is a string of characters to be printed, with each <code>%</code> indicating where one of the other (second, third, ...) arguments is to be substituted, and in what form it is to be printed. For instance, <code>%d</code> specifies an integer argument, so the statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
</code></pre>
<p>causes the values of the two integers fahr and celsius to be printed, with a tab (<code>\t</code>) between them.</p>
<p>Each % construction in the first argument of printf is paired with the corresponding second argument, third argument, etc.; they must match up properly by number and type, or you will get wrong answers.</p>
<p>By the way, printf is not part of the C language; there is no input or output defined in C itself. printf is just a useful function from the standard library of functions that are normally accessible to C programs. The behavior of printf is defined in the ANSI standard, however, so its properties should be the same with any compiler and library that conforms to the standard.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate on C itself, we don't talk much about input and output until <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter7/7-0.html">Chapter 7</a>. In particular, we will defer formatted input until then. If you have to input numbers, read the discussion of the function scanf in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter7/7-4.html">Section 7.4</a>. scanf is like printf, except that it reads input instead of writing output.</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment each <code>%d</code> in the printf statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right-justified in their fields. For instance, we might say</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius); 
</code></pre>
<p>to print the first number of each line in a field three digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">  0    -17 
 20     -6 
 40      4 
 60     15 
 80     26 
100     37 
...
</code></pre>
<p>The more serious problem is that because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate; for instance, 0°F is actually about -17.8°C, not -17. To get more accurate answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program. Here is the second version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table 
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300; floating-point version */ 
int main() { 
    float fahr, celsius; 
    float lower, upper, step; 
    lower = 0; /* lower limit of temperature scale */ 
    upper = 300; /* upper limit */ 
    step = 20; /* step size */ 
    fahr = lower; 
    while (fahr &lt;= upper) { 
          celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0); 
          printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius); 
          fahr = fahr + step; 
    } 
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float and the formula for conversion is written in a more natural way. We were unable to use 5/9 in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, however, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values.</p>
<p>If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written (fahr-32), the 32 would be automatically converted to floating point. Nevertheless, writing floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral values emphasizes their floating-point nature for human readers.</p>
<p>The detailed rules for when integers are converted to floating point are in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter2/2-0.html">Chapter 2</a>. For now, notice that the assignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">fahr = lower; 
</code></pre>
<p>And the test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">while (fahr &lt;= upper) 
</code></pre>
<p>Also work in the natural way - the int is converted to float before the operation is done.</p>
<p>The printf conversion specification <code>%3.0f</code> says that a floating-point number (here fahr) is to be printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits. <code>%6.1f</code> describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. The output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">  0    -17.8
 20     -6.7 
 40      4.4 
...
</code></pre>
<p>Width and precision may be omitted from a specification: <code>%6f</code> says that the number is to be at least six characters wide; <code>%.2f</code> specifies two characters after the decimal point, but the width is not constrained; and <code>%f</code> merely says to print the number as floating point.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Sequence</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>%d</td><td>print as decimal integer</td></tr>
<tr><td>%6d</td><td>print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide</td></tr>
<tr><td>%f</td><td>print as floating point</td></tr>

<tr><td>%.2f</td><td>print as floating point, 2 characters after decimal point</td></tr>
<tr><td>%6.2f</td><td>print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Among others, printf also recognizes <code>%o</code> for octal, <code>%x</code> for hexadecimal, <code>%c</code> for character, <code>%s</code> for character string and <code>%%</code> for itself.</p>

<p>There are plenty of different ways to write a program for a particular task. Let's try a variation on the temperature converter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */ 
int main() { 

    int fahr; 
    for (fahr = 0; fahr &lt;= 300; fahr = fahr + 20) 
        printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32)); 

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
You are allowed to combine the <code>int fahr;</code> and <code>fahr = 0</code>into a single statement inside the body of the for.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (int fahr = 0; fahr &lt;= 300; fahr = fahr + 20)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This produces the same answers, but it certainly looks different. One major change is the elimination of most of the variables; only fahr remains, and we have made it an int. The lower and upper limits and the step size appear only as constants in the for statement, itself a new construction, and the expression that computes the Celsius temperature now appears as the third argument of printf instead of a separate assignment statement.</p>
<p>This last change is an instance of a general rule - in any context where it is permissible to use the value of some type, you can use a more complicated expression of that type. Since the third argument of printf must be a floating-point value to match the <code>%6.1f</code>, any floating point expression can occur here.</p>
<p>The <em>for</em> statement is a loop, a generalization of the while. If you compare it to the earlier while, its operation should be clear. Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by semicolons. The first part, the initialization:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">fahr = 0
</code></pre>
<p>is done once, before the loop proper is entered. The second part is the test or condition that controls the loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">fahr &lt;= 300
</code></pre>
<p>this condition is evaluated; if it is true, the body of the loop (here a single printf) is executed. Then the increment step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">fahr = fahr + 20
</code></pre>
<p>is executed, and the condition re-evaluated. The loop terminates if the condition has become false. As with the while, the body of the loop can be a single statement or a group of statements enclosed in braces. The initialization, condition and increment can be any expressions.</p>
<p>The choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer. The for is usually appropriate for loops in which the initialization and increment are single statements and logically related, since it is more compact than while and it keeps the loop control statements together in one place.</p>

<p>A final observation before we leave temperature conversion forever. It's bad practice to bury "magic numbers" like 300 and 20 in a program; they convey little information to someone who might have to read the program later, and they are hard to change in a systematic way. One way to deal with magic numbers is to give them meaningful names. A "#define" line defines a <em>symbolic name</em> or <em>symbolic constant</em> to be a particular string of characters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define *name replacement list*
</code></pre>
<p>Thereafter, any occurrence of <em>name</em> (not in quotes and not part of another name) will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text. The name has the same form as a variable name: a sequence of letters and digits that begins with a letter. The replacement text can be any sequence of characters; it is not limited to numbers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define LOWER 0    /* lower limit of table */
#define UPPER 300  /* upper limit */
#define STEP 20    /* step size */

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
int main() {

    int fahr;
    for (fahr = LOWER; fahr &lt;= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP)
        printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The quantities LOWER, UPPER and STEP are symbolic constants, not variables, so they do not appear in declarations. Symbolic constant names are conventionally written in upper case so they can be readily distinguished from lower case variable names. Notice that there is no semicolon at the end of a #define line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
Though it is definitely valid to use this approach, by doing so you are obscuring the potential type of the value. LOWER could be an int in one place or a float in another. Because of this it's better to keep definitions for actual constants like Pi or Tau or the speed of light.
In all other cases, a clear type with a value at the top of your code or main function might be a better idea.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="character-input-and-output"><a class="header" href="#character-input-and-output">Character Input and Output</a></h1>
<p>We are going to consider a family of related programs for processing character data. You will find that many programs are just expanded versions of the prototypes that we discuss here.</p>
<p>The model of input and output supported by the standard library is very simple. Text input or output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of characters. A <em>text stream</em> is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character. It is the responsibility of the library to make each input or output stream conform this model; the C programmer using the library need not worry about how lines are represented outside the program.</p>
<p>The standard library provides several functions for reading or writing one character at a time, of which getchar and putchar are the simplest. Each time it is called, getchar reads the next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. That is, after:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">c = getchar();
</code></pre>
<p>the variable c contains the next character of input. The characters normally come from the keyboard; input from files is discussed in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter7/7-0.html">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p>The function putchar prints a character each time it is called:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">putchar(c);
</code></pre>
<p>prints the contents of the integer variable c as a character, usually on the screen. Calls to putchar and printf may be interleaved; the output will appear in the order in which the calls are made.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="file-copying"><a class="header" href="#file-copying">File Copying</a></h1>
<p>Given getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about input and output. The simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one character at a time:</p>
<pre><code>read a character
while (character is not end-of-file indicator) 
    output the character just read 
    read a character
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
The short bit written above is what's called "pseudocode".<br />
It doesn't adhere to the specific syntax of a programming language, yet allows you to sketch out the general flow and needs of your program. It's a powerful tool to writing better code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Converting this into C gives:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* copy input to output; 1st version */ 
int main() { 

    int c; 
    c = getchar(); 
    while (c != EOF) { 
        putchar(c); 
        c = getchar(); 
    } 
    return 0; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The relational operator <code>!=</code> means "not equal to".</p>
<p>What appears to be a character on the keyboard or screen is of course, like everything else, stored internally just as a bit pattern. The type <em>char</em> is specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can be used. We used int for a subtle but important reason.</p>
<p>The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The solution is that getchar returns a distinctive value when there is no more input, a value that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called EOF, for "end of file". We must declare c to be a type big enough to hold any value that getchar returns. We can't use char since c must be big enough to hold EOF in addition to any possible char. Therefore we use int.</p>
<p>EOF is an integer defined in <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, but the specific numeric value doesn't matter as long as it is not the same as any char value. By using the symbolic constant, we are assured that nothing in the program depends on the specific numeric value.</p>
<p>The program for copying would be written more concisely by experienced C programmers. In C, any assignment, such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">c = getchar();
</code></pre>
<p>is an expression and has a value, which is the value of the left hand side after the assignment. This means that a assignment can appear as part of a larger expression. If the assignment of a character to c is put inside the test part of a while loop, the copy program can be written this way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* copy input to output; 2nd version */ 
int main() { 

    int c; 
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) 
        putchar(c); 

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The while gets a character, assigns it to c, and then tests whether the character was the "end of file" - signal. If it was not, the body of the while is executed, printing the character. The while then repeats. When the end of the input is finally reached, the while terminates and so does main.</p>
<p>This version centralizes the input - there is now only one reference to getchar - and shrinks the program. The resulting program is more compact, and, once the idiom is mastered, easier to read. You'll see this style often. (It's possible to get carried away and create impenetrable code, however, a tendency that we will try to curb.)</p>
<p>The parentheses around the assignment, within the condition are necessary. The <em>precedence</em> of != is higher than that of =, which means that in the absence of parentheses the relational test != would be done before the assignment =. So the statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">c = getchar() != EOF 
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">c = (getchar() != EOF)
</code></pre>
<p>This has the undesired effect of setting c to 0 or 1, depending on whether or not the call of getchar returned end of file. (More on this in Chapter 2.)</p>
<p><a href="Chapter1/../Solutions/Chapter1/E1-6.html"><strong>Exercise 1-6.</strong></a> Verify that the expression <code>getchar() != EOF</code> is 0 or 1.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter1/../Solutions/Chapter1/E1-7.html"><strong>Exercise 1-7.</strong></a> Write a program to print the value of EOF.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="character-counting"><a class="header" href="#character-counting">Character Counting</a></h1>
<p>The next program counts characters; it is similar to the copy program.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* count characters in input; 1st version */ 
int main() { 

    long nc; 
    nc = 0; 
    while (getchar() != EOF) 
        ++nc; 
    printf("%ld\n", nc); 
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The statement</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">++nc;
</code></pre>
<p>presents a new operator, ++, which means <em>increment by one</em>. You could instead write <code>nc = nc + 1</code> but ++nc is more concise and often more efficient. There is a corresponding operator -- to decrement by 1. The operators ++ and -- can be either prefix operators (++nc) or postfix operators (nc++); these two forms have different values in expressions, as will be shown in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter2/2-0.html">Chapter 2</a>, but ++nc and nc++ both increment nc. For the moment we will will stick to the prefix form.</p>
<p>The character counting program accumulates its count in a long variable instead of an int. long integers are at least 32 bits. Although on some machines, int and long are the same size, on others an int is 16 bits, with a maximum value of 32767, and it would take relatively little input to overflow an int counter. The conversion specification %ld tells printf that the corresponding argument is a long integer.</p>
<p>It may be possible to cope with even bigger numbers by using a double (double precision float). We will also use a for statement instead of a while, to illustrate another way to write the loop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* count characters in input; 2nd version */ 
int main() { 
    double nc; 
    for (nc = 0; getchar() != EOF; ++nc)
        ; 
    printf("%.0f\n", nc); 
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>printf uses <code>%f</code> for both float and double; <code>%.0f</code> suppresses the printing of the decimal point and the fraction part, which is zero.</p>
<p>The body of this for loop is empty, because all the work is done in the test and increment parts. But the grammatical rules of C require that a for statement have a body. The isolated semicolon, called a <em>null statement</em>, is there to satisfy that requirement. We put it on a separate line to make it visible.</p>
<p>Before we leave the character counting program, observe that if the input contains no characters, the while or for test fails on the very first call to getchar, and the program produces zero, the right answer. This is important. One of the nice things about while and for is that they test at the top of the loop, before proceeding with the body. If there is nothing to do, nothing is done, even if that means never going through the loop body. Programs should act intelligently when given zero-length input. The while and for statements help ensure that programs do reasonable things with boundary conditions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="line-counting"><a class="header" href="#line-counting">Line Counting</a></h1>
<p>The next program counts input lines. As we mentioned above, the standard library ensures that an input text stream appears as a sequence of lines, each terminated by a newline. Hence, counting lines is just counting newlines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
/* count lines in input */ 
int main() { 

    int c, nl; 

    nl = 0; 
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) 
        if (c == '\n') 
            ++nl; 
    printf("%d\n", nl); 

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The body of the while now consists of an if, which in turn controls the increment ++nl. The if statement tests the parenthesized condition, and if the condition is true, executes the statement (or group of statements in braces) that follows. We have again indented to show what is controlled by what.</p>
<p>The double equals sign == is the C notation for "is equal to" (like Pascal's single = or Fortran's <em>.EQ.</em>). This symbol is used to distinguish the equality test from the single = that C uses for assignment. A word of caution: newcomers to C occasionally write = when they mean ==. As we will see in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter2/2-0.html">Chapter 2</a>, the result is usually a legal expression, so you will get no warning.</p>
<p>A character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character in the machine's character set. This is called a <em>character constant</em>, although it is just another way to write a small integer. So, for example, 'A' is a character constant; in the ASCII character set its value is 65, the internal representation of the character A. Of course, 'A' is to be preferred over 65: its meaning is obvious, and it is independent of a particular character set.</p>
<p>The escape sequences used in string constants are also legal in character constants, so <code>\n</code> stands for the value of the newline character, which is 10 in ASCII. You should note carefully that <code>\n</code> is a single character, and in expressions is just an integer; on the other hand, <code>\n</code> is a string constant that happens to contain only one character. The topic of strings versus characters is discussed further in Chapter 2.</p>

<p>The fourth in our series of useful programs counts lines, words, and characters, with the loose definition that a word is any sequence of characters that does not contain a blank, tab or newline. This is a bare-bones version of the UNIX program "wc".</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 

#define IN 1 /* inside a word */ 
#define OUT 0 /* outside a word */ 

/* count lines, words, and characters in input */ 
int main() { 

    int c, nl, nw, nc, state; 

    state = OUT; 
    nl = nw = nc = 0; 
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) { 
        ++nc; 
        if (c == '\n') 
            ++nl; 
        if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t') 
            state = OUT; 
        else if (state == OUT) { 
            state = IN; 
            ++nw; 
        } 
    } 
    printf("%d %d %d\n", nl, nw, nc); 

    return 0;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Every time the program encounters the first character of a word, it counts one more word. The variable <em>state</em> records whether the program is currently in a word or not; initially it is "not in a word", which is assigned the value OUT. We prefer the symbolic constants IN and OUT to the literal values 1 and 0 because they make the program more readable. In a program as tiny as this, it makes little difference, but in larger programs, the increase in clarity is well worth the modest extra effort to write it this way from the beginning. You'll also find that it's easier to make extensive changes in programs where magic numbers appear only as symbolic constants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
You could also use a boolean value called "inaword" and set it to either true or false to keep track of the current state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">nl = nw = nc = 0; 
</code></pre>
<p>sets all three variables to zero. This is not a special case, but a consequence of the fact that an assignment is an expression with the value and assignments associated from right to left. It's as if we had written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">nl = (nw = (nc = 0)); 
</code></pre>
<p>The operator || means OR, so the line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t')
</code></pre>
<p>says "if c is a blank <em>or</em> c is a newline <em>or</em> c is a tab". (Recall that the escape sequence <code>\t</code> is a visible representation of the tab character.) There is a corresponding operator &amp;&amp; for AND; its precedence is just higher than ||. Expressions connected by &amp;&amp; or || are evaluated left to right, and it is guaranteed that evaluation will stop as soon as the truth or falsehood is known. If c is a blank, there is no need to test whether it is a newline or tab, so these tests are not made. This isn't particularly important here, but is significant in more complicated situations, as we will soon see.</p>
<p>The example also shows an else, which specifies an alternative action if the condition part of an if statement is false. The general form is:</p>
<pre><code>if (expression) 
    statement1
else 
    statement2
</code></pre>
<p>One and only one of the two statements associated with an if-else is performed. If the <em>expression</em> is true, <em>statement1</em> is executed; if not, <em>statement2</em> is executed. Each <em>statement</em> can be a single statement or several in braces. In the word count program, the one after the else is an if that controls two statements in braces.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="arrays"><a class="header" href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h1>
<p>Let us write a program to count the number of occurrences of each digit, of white space characters (blank, tab, newline), and of all other characters. This is artificial, but it permits us to illustrate several aspects of C in one program.</p>
<p>There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array to hold the number of occurrences of each digit, rather than ten individual variables. Here is one version of the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 

/* count digits, white space, others */ 
int main() { 

    int c, i, nwhite, nother; 
    int ndigit[10]; 

    nwhite = nother = 0; 
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) 
        ndigit[i] = 0; 

    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) 
        if (c &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9') 
            ++ndigit[c-'0']; 
        else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t') 
            ++nwhite; 
        else 
            ++nother; 

    printf("digits ="); 
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) 
        printf(" %d", ndigit[i]); 
    printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n", nwhite, nother); 

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The output of this program on itself is:</p>
<pre><code>digits = 9 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1, white space = 123, other = 345 
</code></pre>
<p>The declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int ndigit[10];
</code></pre>
<p>declares ndigit to be an array of 10 integers. Array subscripts always start at zero in C, so the elements are ndigit[0], ndigit[1], ... ndigit[9]. This is reflected in the for loops that initialize and print the array.</p>
<p>A subscript can be any integer expression, which includes integer variables like i, and integer constants.</p>
<p>This particular program relies on the properties of the character representation of the digits. For example, the test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (c &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9')
</code></pre>
<p>determines whether the character in c is a digit. If it is, the numeric value of that digit is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">c - '0'
</code></pre>
<p>This works only if '0', '1', ..., '9' have consecutive increasing values. Fortunately, this is true for all character sets.</p>
<p>By definition, chars are just small integers, so char variables and constants are identical to ints in arithmetic expressions. This is natural and convenient; for example c-'0' is an integer expression with a value between 0 and 9 corresponding to the character '0' to '9' stored in c, and thus a valid subscript for the array ndigit.</p>
<p>The decision as to whether a character is a digit, white space, or something else is made with the sequence:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (c &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9') 
    ++ndigit[c-'0']; 
else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t') 
    ++nwhite; 
else 
    ++nother; 
</code></pre>
<p>The pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (*condition1*) 
    *statement1* 
else if (*condition2*) 
    *statement2* 
    ...
    ... 
else
    *statementn*
</code></pre>
<p>occurs frequently in programs as a way to express a multi-way decision. The <em>conditions</em> are evaluated in order from the top until some <em>condition</em> is satisfied; at that point the corresponding <em>statement</em> part is executed, and the entire construction is finished. (Any <em>statement</em> can be several statements enclosed in braces.) If none of the conditions is satisfied, the <em>statement</em> after the final else is executed if it is present. If the final else and <em>statement</em> are omitted, as in the word count program, no action takes place. There can be any number of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">else if(*condition*) 
    *statement*
</code></pre>
<p>groups between the initial if and the final else.</p>
<p>As a matter of style, it is advisable to format this construction as we have shown; if each if were indented past the previous else, a long sequence of decisions would march off the right side of the page.</p>
<p>The switch statement, to be discussed in Chapter 4, provides another way to write a multi way branch that is particularly suitable when the condition is whether some integer or character expression matches one of a set of constants. For contrast, we will present a switch version of this program in Section 3.4.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h1>
<p>In C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran, or a procedure or function in Pascal. A function provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation, which can then be used without worrying about its implementation. With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore <em>how</em> a job is done; knowing <em>what</em> is done is sufficient. C makes the sue of functions easy, convenient and efficient; you will often see a short function defined and called only once, just because it clarifies some piece of code.</p>
<p>So far we have used only functions like printf, getchar and putchar that have been provided for us; now it's time to write a few of our own. Since C has no exponentiation operator like the ** of Fortran, let us illustrate the mechanics of function definition by writing a function power(m,n) to raise an integer m to a positive integer power n. That is, the value of power(2,5) is 32. This function is not a practical exponentiation routine, since it handles only positive powers of small integers, but it's good enough for illustration.(The standard library contains a function pow(x,y) that computes <em>x^y</em> .)</p>
<p>Here is the function <em>power</em> and a main program to exercise it, so you can see the whole structure at once.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 

int power(int m, int n); 

/* test power function */ 
int main() { 

    int i; 

    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) 
        printf("%d %d %d\n", i, power(2,i), power(-3,i)); 
    return 0; 
} 

/* power: raise base to n-th power; n &gt;= 0 */ 
int power(int base, int n) { 

    int i, p; 

    p = 1; 
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; ++i) 
        p = p * base; 
    return p; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>A function definition has this form:</p>
<pre><code>return-type function-name(parameter declarations, if any) { 
    declarations 
    statements 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Function definitions can appear in any order, and in one source file or several, although no function can be split between files. If the source program appears in several files, you may have to say more to compile and load it than if it all appears in one, but that is an operating system matter, not a language attribute. For the moment, we will assume that both functions are in the same file, so whatever you have learned about running C programs will still work.</p>
<p>The function <em>power</em> is called twice by main, in the line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("%d %d %d\n", i, power(2,i), power(-3,i));
</code></pre>
<p>Each call passes two arguments to <em>power</em>, which each time returns an integer to be formatted and printed. In an expression, <em>power(2,i)</em> is an integer just as 2 and i are. (Not all functions produce an integer value; we will take this up in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a>.)</p>
<p>The first line of <em>power</em> itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int power(int base, int n)
</code></pre>
<p>declares the parameter types and names, and the type of the result that the function returns. The names used by power for its parameters are local to power, and are not visible to any other function: other routines can use the same names without conflict. This is also true of the variables i and p: the i in power is unrelated to the i in main.</p>
<p>We will generally use <em>parameter</em> for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function. The terms <em>formal argument</em> and <em>actual argument</em> are sometimes used for the same distinction.</p>
<p>The value that power computes is returned to main by the <code>return</code> statement. Any expression may follow return:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">return *expression*;
</code></pre>
<p>A function need not return a value; a return statement with no expression causes control, but no useful value, to be returned to the caller, as does "falling off the end" of a function by reaching the terminating right brace. And the calling function can ignore a value returned by a function.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that there is a return statement at the end of main. Since main is a function like any other, it may return a value to its caller, which is in effect the environment in which the program was executed. Typically, a return value of zero implies normal termination; non-zero values signal unusual or erroneous termination conditions. In the interests of simplicity, we have omitted return statements from our main functions up to this point, but we will include them hereafter, as a reminder that programs should return status to their environment.</p>
<p>The declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int power(int base, int n);
</code></pre>
<p>Just before main says that power is a function that expects two int arguments and returns an int. This declaration, which is called a <em>function prototype</em>, has to agree with the definition and uses of power. It is an error if the definition of a function or any uses of it do not agree with its prototype.</p>
<p>parameter names need not agree. Indeed, parameter names are optional in a function prototype, so for the prototype we could have written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int power(int, int); 
</code></pre>
<p>Well-chosen names are good documentation however, so we will often use them.</p>
<p>A note of history: the biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions are declared and defined. In the original definition of C, the power function would have been written like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* power: raise base to n-th power; n &gt;= 0 */ 
/* (old-style version) */ 
power(base, n) 
int base, n; 
{ 
    int i, p; 
    p = 1; 
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; ++i) 
        p = p * base; 
    return p; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The parameters are named between the parentheses, and their types are declared before opening the left brace; undeclared parameters are taken as int. (The body of the function is the same as before.)</p>
<p>The declaration of power at the beginning of the program would have looked like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int power();
</code></pre>
<p>No parameter list was permitted, so the compiler could not readily check that power was being called correctly. Indeed, since by default power would have been assumed to return an int, the entire declaration might well have been omitted.</p>
<p>The new syntax of function prototypes makes it much easier for a compiler to detect errors in the number of arguments or their types. The old style of declaration and definition still works in ANSI C, at least for a transition period, but we strongly recommend that you use the new form when you have a compiler that supports it.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="arguments---call-by-value"><a class="header" href="#arguments---call-by-value">Arguments - Call by Value</a></h1>
<p>One aspec   t of C functions may be unfamiliar to programmers who are used to some other languages, particularly Fortran. In C, all function arguments are passed "by value". This means that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals. This leads to some different properties than are seen with "call by reference" languages like Fortran or with var parameters in Pascal, in which the called routine has access to the original argument, not a local copy.</p>
<p>Call by value is an asset, however, not a liability. It usually leads to more compact programs with fewer extraneous variables, because parameters can be treated as conveniently initialized local variables in the called routine. For example, here is a version of power that makes use of this property.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> /* power: raise base to n-th power; n &gt;= 0; version 2 */ 
int power(int base, int n) { 
    int p; 
    for (p = 1; n &gt; 0; --n) 
        p = p * base; 
    return p; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The parameter n is used as a temporary variable, and is counted down (a for loop that runs backwards) until it becomes zero; there is no longer a need for the variable i. Whatever is done to n inside power has no effect on the argument that power was originally called with.</p>
<p>When necessary, it is possible to arrange for a function to modify a variable in a calling routine. The caller must provide the <em>address</em> of the variable to be set (technically a <em>pointer</em> to the variable), and the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the variable indirectly through it. We will cover pointers in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter5/5-0.html">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p>The story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array - there is no copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any argument of the array. This is the topic of the next section.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="character-arrays"><a class="header" href="#character-arrays">Character Arrays</a></h1>
<p>The most common type of array in C is the array of characters. To illustrate the use of character arrays and functions to manipulate them, let's write a program that reads a set of text lines and prints the longest. The outline is simple enough:</p>
<pre><code>while (there's another line) 
    if (it's longer than the previous longest) 
        (save it) 
        (save its length) 
print longest line
</code></pre>
<p>This outline makes it clear that the program divides naturally into pieces. One piece gets a new line, another saves it, and the rest controls the process.</p>
<p>Since things divide so nicely, it would be well to write them that way too. Accordingly, let us first write a separate function getline to fetch the next line of input. We will try to make the function useful in other contexts. At the minimum, getline has to return a signal about possible end of file; a more useful design would be to return the length of the line, or zero if end of file is encountered. Zero is an acceptable end-of-file return because it is never a valid line length. Every text line has at least one character; even a line containing only a newline has length 1.</p>
<p>When we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere. This suggests a second function, copy, to copy the new line to a safe place.</p>
<p>Finally, we need a main program to control getline and copy. Here is the result.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#define MAXLINE 1000 /* maximum input line length */

int getline(char line[], int maxline);
void copy(char to[], char from[]);

/* print the longest input line */
int main() {

    int len;                /* current line length */
    int max;                /* maximum length seen so far */
    char line[MAXLINE];     /* current input line */
    char longest[MAXLINE];  /* longest line saved here */

    max = 0;
    while ((len = getline(line, MAXLINE)) &gt; 0) 
        if (len &gt; max) { 
            max = len; 
            copy(longest, line); 
        }
    if (max &gt; 0)            /* there was a line */ 
        printf("%s", longest);

    return 0; 
}

/* getline: read a line into s, return length */
int getline(char s[], int lim) { 

    int c, i; 
    for (i = 0; i &lt; lim - 1 &amp;&amp; (c = getchar()) != EOF &amp;&amp; c != '\n'; ++i) 
        s[i] = c; 
    if (c == '\n') { 
        s[i] = c; 
        ++i; 
    } 
    s[i] = '\0'; 
    return i; 
}

/* copy: copy 'from' into 'to'; assume to is big enough */
void copy(char to[], char from[]) {

    int i = 0; 
    while ((to[i] = from[i]) != '\0') 
        ++i; 
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
To actually get this to compile, you need to indicate that the getline  function is locally defined.</p>
<p>Why? Well <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> already defines a version of that function (on most systems that are POSIX compliant), and the compiler will complain that they don't have the same prototype.
By just adding "_local" to the name, you bypass this issue easily.</p>
<p>(It just gives it a different name, so the compiler assumes they are different functions)</p>
<p>Check the code examples folder for fully working (and tested) versions of the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The functions getline and copy are declared at the beginning of the program, which we assume is contained in one file.</p>
<p>main and getline communicate through a pair of arguments and a returned value. In getline, the arguments are declared by the line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int getline(char s[], int lim);
</code></pre>
<p>which specifies that the first argument, s, is an array, and the second, lim, is an integer. The purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is to set aside storage. The length of an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main. getline uses return to send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. This line also declares that getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted.</p>
<p>Some functions return a useful value; others, like copy, are used only for their effect and return no value. The return type of copy is void, which states explicitly that no value is returned.</p>
<p>getline puts the character <code>\0</code> (the <em>null character</em>, whose value is zero) at the end of the array it is creating, to mark the end of the string of characters. This conversion is also used by the C language: when a string constant like</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">"hello\n"
</code></pre>
<p>appears in a C program, it is stored as an array of characters containing the characters in the string and terminated with a <code>\0</code> to mark the end.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Index</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Character</td><td>h</td><td>e</td><td>l</td><td>l</td><td>o</td><td>\n</td><td>\0</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The <code>%s</code> format specification in printf expects the corresponding argument to be a string represented in this form. copy also relies on the fact that its input argument is terminated with a <code>\0</code>, and copies this character into the output.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning in passing that even a program as small as this one presents some sticky design problems. For example, what should main do if it encounters a line which is bigger than its limit? getline works safely, in that it stops collecting when the array is full, even if no newline has been seen. By testing the length and the last character returned, main can determine whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes. In the interests of brevity, we have ignored this issue.</p>
<p>There is no way for a user of getline to know in advance how long an input line might be, so getline checks for overflow. On the other hand, the user of copy already knows (or can find out) how big the strings are, so we have chosen not to add error checking to it.</p>

<p>The variables in main, such as line, longest, etc., are private or local to main. Because they are declared within main, no other function can have direct access to them. The same is true of the variables in other functions; for example, the variable i in getline is unrelated to the i in copy.</p>
<p>Each local variable in a function comes into existence only when the function is called, and disappears when the function is exited. This is why such variables are usually known as <em>automatic</em> variables, following terminology in other languages. We will use the term automatic henceforth to refer to these local variables. (<a href="Chapter1/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a> discusses the static storage class, in which local variables do retain their values between calls.)</p>
<p>Because automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their values from one call to the next, and must be explicitly set upon each entry. If they are not set, they will contain garbage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
With "garbage", they mean that the stored value is not initialised and might be some random value that was stored there earlier. This is in contrast to 0-initialisation, where the value is promised to be set to 0 even when not explicitly requested.
C often opts for the non-initialised values, since it is more efficient. (though this does mean that you as a programmer are responsible for initialising your variables)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are <em>external</em> to all functions, that is, variables that can be accessed by name by any function. (This mechanism is rather like Fortran COMMON or Pascal variables declared in the outermost block.) Because external variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between functions. Furthermore, because external variables remain in existence permanently, rather than appearing and disappearing as functions are called and exited, they retain their values even after the functions that set them have returned.</p>
<p>An external variable must be <em>defined</em>, exactly once, outside of any function; this sets aside storage for it. The variable must also be <em>declared</em> in each function that wants to access it; this states the type of the variable. The declaration may be an explicit extern statement or may be implicit from context. To make the discussion concrete, let us rewrite the longest-line program with line, longest, and max as external variables. This requires changing the calls, declarations, and bodies of all three functions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#define MAXLINE 1000    /* maximum input line size */

int max;                /* maximum length seen so far */
char line[MAXLINE];     /* current input line */
char longest[MAXLINE];  /* longest line saved here */

int getline(void);
void copy(void);

/* print longest input line; specialized version */
main() {

    int len;
    extern int max;
    extern char longest[];

    max = 0;
    while ((len = getline()) &gt; 0)
        if (len &gt; max) {
            max = len;
            copy();
        }
    if (max &gt; 0)        /* there was a line */
        printf("%s", longest);
    return 0;
}

/* getline: specialized version */
int getline(void) {

    int c, i;
    extern char line[];

    for (i = 0; i &lt; MAXLINE - 1 &amp;&amp; (c = getchar()) != EOF &amp;&amp; c != '\n'; ++i)
        line[i] = c;
    if (c == '\n') {
        line[i] = c;
        ++i;
    }
    line[i] = '\0';
    return i;
}

/* copy: specialized version */
void copy(void) {

    int i;
    extern char line[], longest[];

    i = 0;
    while ((longest[i] = line[i]) != '\0')
        ++i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The external variables in main, getline and copy are defined by the first lines of the example above, which state their type and cause storage to be allocated for them. Syntactically, external definitions are just like definitions of local variables, but since they occur outside of functions, the variables are external. Before a function can use an external variable, the name of the variable must be made known to the function; the declaration is the same as before except for the added keyword extern.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, the extern declaration can be omitted. If the definition of the external variable occurs in the source file before its use in a particular function, then there is no need for an extern declaration in the function. The extern declarations in main, getline and copy are thus redundant. In fact, common practice is to place definitions of all external variables at the beginning of the source file, and then omit all extern declarations.</p>
<p>If the program is in several source files, and a variable is defined in <em>file1</em> and used in <em>file2</em> and <em>file3</em>, then extern declarations are needed in <em>file2</em> and <em>file3</em> to connect the occurrences of the variable. The usual practice is to collect extern declarations of variables and functions in a separate file, historically called a <em>header</em>, that is included by <code>#include</code> at the front of each source file. The suffix <code>.h</code> is conventional for header names. The functions of the standard library, for example, are declared in headers like <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>. This topic is discussed at length in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a>, and the library itself in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter7/7-0.html">Chapter 7</a> and <a href="Chapter1/../AppendixB/B0.html">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>Since the specialized versions of getline and copy have no arguments, logic would suggest that their prototypes at the beginning of the file should be getline() and copy(). But for compatibility with older C programs the standard takes an empty list as an old-style declaration, and turns off all argument list checking; the word void must be used for an explicitly empty list. We will discuss this further in <a href="Chapter1/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p>You should note that we are using the words <em>definition</em> and <em>declaration</em> carefully when we refer to external variables in this section."Definition" refers to the place where the variable is created or assigned storage; "declaration" refers to places where the nature of the variable is stated but no storage is allocated.</p>
<p>By the way, there is a tendency to make everything in sight an extern variable because it appears to simplify communications - argument lists are short and variables are always there when you want them. But external variables are always there even when you don't want them. Relying too heavily on external variables is fraught with peril since it leads to programs whose data connections are not all obvious - variables can be changed in unexpected and even inadvertent ways, and the program is hard to modify. The second version of the longest-line program is inferior to the first, partly for these reasons, and partly because it destroys the generality of two useful functions by writing into them the names of the variables they manipulate.</p>
<p>At this point we have covered what might be called the conventional core of C. With this handful of building blocks, it's possible to write useful programs of considerable size, and it would probably be a good idea if you paused long enough to do so. These exercises suggest programs of somewhat greater complexity than the ones earlier in this chapter.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-2---types-operators-and-expressions"><a class="header" href="#chapter-2---types-operators-and-expressions">Chapter 2 - Types, Operators and Expressions</a></h1>
<p>Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program. Declarations list the variables to be used, and state what type they have and perhaps what their initial values are. Operators specify what is to be done to them. Expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values. The type of an object determines the set of values it can have and what operations can be performed on it. These building blocks are the topics of this chapter.</p>
<p>The ANSI standard has made many small changes and additions to basic types and expressions. There are now signed and unsigned forms of all integer types, and notations for unsigned constants and hexadecimal character constants. Floating-point operations may be done in single precision; there is also a long double type for extended precision. String constants may be concatenated at compile time. Enumerations have become part of the language, formalizing a feature of long standing. Objects may be declared const, which prevents them from being changed. The rules for automatic coercions among arithmetic types have been augmented to handle the richer set of types.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variable-names"><a class="header" href="#variable-names">Variable Names</a></h1>
<p>Although we didn't say so in <a href="Chapter2/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a>, there are some restrictions on the names of variables and symbolic constants. Names are made up of letters and digits; the first character must be a letter. The underscore "_" counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for improving the readability of long variable names. Don't begin variable names with underscore, however, since library routines often use such names. Upper and lower case letters are distinct, so x and X are two different names. Traditional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all upper case for symbolic constants.</p>
<p>At least the first 31 characters of an internal name are significant. For function names and external variables, the number may be less than 31, because external names may be used by assemblers and loaders over which the language has no control. For external names, the standard guarantees uniqueness only for 6 characters and a single case. Keywords like if, else, int, float, etc., are reserved: you can't use them as variable names. They must be in lower case.</p>
<p>It's wise to choose variable names that are related to the purpose of the variable, and that are unlikely to get mixed up typographically. We tend to use short names for local variables, especially loop indices, and longer names for external variables.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="data-types-and-sizes"><a class="header" href="#data-types-and-sizes">Data Types and Sizes</a></h1>
<p>There are only a few basic data types in C:</p>
<ul>
<li>char: a single byte, capable of holding one character in the local character set</li>
<li>int: an integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine</li>
<li>float: single-precision floating point</li>
<li>double: double-precision floating point</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are a number of qualifiers that can be applied to these basic types. short and long apply to integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">short int sh; 
long int counter; 
</code></pre>
<p>The word int can be omitted in such declarations, and typically it is.</p>
<p>The intent is that short and long should provide different lengths of integers where practical; int will normally be the natural size for a particular machine. short is often 16 bits long, and int either 16 or 32 bits. Each compiler is free to choose appropriate sizes for its own hardware, subject only to the restriction that shorts and ints are at least 16 bits, longs are at least 32 bits, and short is no longer than int, which is no longer than long.</p>
<p>The qualifier signed or unsigned may be applied to char or any integer. unsigned numbers are always positive or zero, and obey the laws of arithmetic modulo <em>2n</em> , where <em>n</em> is the number of bits in the type. So, for instance, if chars are 8 bits, unsigned char variables have values between 0 and 255, while signed chars have values between -128 and 127 (in a two's complement machine.) Whether plain chars are signed or unsigned is machine-dependent, but printable characters are always positive.</p>
<p>The type long double specifies extended-precision floating point. As with integers, the sizes of floating-point objects are implementation-defined; float, double and long double could represent one, two or three distinct sizes.</p>
<p>The standard headers <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code> contain symbolic constants for all of these sizes, along with other properties of the machine and compiler. These are discussed in <a href="Chapter2/../AppendixB/B0.html">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter2/../Solutions/Chapter2/E2-1.html"><strong>Exercise 2-1.</strong></a> Write a program to determine the ranges of char, short, int, and long variables, both signed and unsigned, by printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating-point types.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="constants"><a class="header" href="#constants">Constants</a></h1>
<p>An integer constant like 1234 is an int. A long constant is written with a terminal l (ell) or L, as in 123456789L; an integer constant too big to fit into an int will also be taken as a long. Unsigned constants are written with a terminal u or U, and the suffix ul or UL indicates unsigned long.</p>
<p>Floating-point constants contain a decimal point (123.4) or an exponent (1e-2) or both; their type is double, unless suffixed. The suffixes f or F indicate a float constant; l or L indicate a long double.</p>
<p>The value of an integer can be specified in octal or hexadecimal instead of decimal. A leading 0 (zero) on an integer constant means octal; a leading 0x or 0X means hexadecimal. For example, decimal 31 can be written as 037 in octal and 0x1f or 0x1F in hex. Octal and hexadecimal constants may also be followed by L to make them long and U to make them unsigned: 0XFUL is an <em>unsigned long</em> constant with value 15 decimal.</p>
<p>A character constant is an integer, written as one character within single quotes, such as 'x'. The value of a character constant is the numeric value of the character in the machine's character set. For example, in the ASCII character set the character constant '0' has the value 48, which is unrelated to the numeric value 0. If we write '0' instead of a numeric value like 48 that depends on the character set, the program is independent of the particular value and easier to read. Character constants participate in numeric operations just as any other integers, although they are most often used in comparisons with other characters.</p>
<p>Certain characters can be represented in character and string constants by escape sequences like <code>\n</code> (newline); these sequences look like two characters, but represent only one. In addition, an arbitrary byte-sized bit pattern can be specified by</p>
<p><code>\ooo</code></p>
<p>where <em>ooo</em> is one to three octal digits (0...7) or by</p>
<p><code>\xhh</code></p>
<p>where <em>hh</em> is one or more hexadecimal digits (0...9, a...f, A...F). So we might write</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define VTAB '\013' /* ASCII vertical tab */ 
#define BELL '\007' /* ASCII bell character */
</code></pre>
<p>or, in hexadecimal,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define VTAB '\xb' /* ASCII vertical tab */ 
#define BELL '\x7' /* ASCII bell character */
</code></pre>
<p>The complete set of escape sequences is</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Escape sequence</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Escape sequence</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>\a</code></td><td>alert (bell) character</td><td><code>\\</code></td><td>backslash</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\b</code></td><td>backspace</td><td><code>\?</code></td><td>question mark</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\f</code></td><td>formfeed</td><td><code>\'</code></td><td>single quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\n</code></td><td>newline</td><td><code>\"</code></td><td>double quote</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\r</code></td><td>carriage return</td><td><code>\ooo</code></td><td>octal number</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\t</code></td><td>horizontal tab</td><td><code>\xhh</code></td><td>hexadecimal number</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\v</code></td><td>vertical tab</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The character constant <code>\0</code> represents the character with value zero, the null character. <code>\</code>' is often written instead of 0 to emphasize the character nature of some expression, but the numeric value is just 0.</p>
<p>A <em>constant expression</em> is an expression that involves only constants. Such expressions may be evaluated at compile-time rather than run-time, and accordingly may be used in any place that a constant can occur, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define MAXLINE 1000 
char line[MAXLINE+1]; 
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define LEAP 1 /* in leap years */ 
int days[31+28+LEAP+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31];
</code></pre>
<p>A <em>string constant</em>, or <em>string literal</em>, is a sequence of zero or more characters surrounded by double quotes, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">"I am a string" 
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"> "" /* the empty string */
</code></pre>
<p>The quotes are not part of the string, but serve only to delimit it. The same escape sequences used in character constants apply in strings; <code>\"</code> represents the double-quote character. String constants can be concatenated at compile time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">"hello, " "world" 
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">"hello, world" 
</code></pre>
<p>This is useful for splitting up long strings across several source lines.</p>
<p>Technically, a string constant is an array of characters. The internal representation of a string has a null character <code>\0</code> at the end, so the physical storage required is one more than the number of characters written between the quotes. This representation means that there is no limit to how long a string can be, but programs must scan a string completely to determine its length. The standard library function <code>strlen(s)</code> returns the length of its character string argument s, excluding the terminal <code>\0</code>. Here is our version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strlen: return length of s */ 
int strlen(char s[]) { 

    int i = 0; 

    while (s[i] != '\0') 
        ++i; 
    return i; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>strlen and other string functions are declared in the standard header <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Be careful to distinguish between a character constant and a string that contains a single character: 'x' is not the same as "x". The former is an integer, used to produce the numeric value of the letter <em>x</em> in the machine's character set. The latter is an array of characters that contains one character (the letter <em>x</em>) and a <code>\0</code>.</p>
<p>There is one other kind of constant, the <em>enumeration constant</em>. An enumeration is a list of constant integer values, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">enum boolean { NO, YES }; 
</code></pre>
<p>The first name in an enum has value 0, the next 1, and so on, unless explicit values are specified. If not all values are specified, unspecified values continue the progression from the last specified value, as the second of these examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">enum escapes { BELL = '\a', BACKSPACE = '\b', TAB = '\t', 
               NEWLINE = '\n', VTAB = '\v', RETURN = '\r' }; 

enum months { JAN = 1, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, 
              JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC }; 

            /* FEB = 2, MAR = 3, etc. */
</code></pre>
<p>Names in different enumerations must be distinct. Values need not be distinct in the same enumeration.</p>
<p>Enumerations provide a convenient way to associate constant values with names, an alternative to <code>#define</code> with the advantage that the values can be generated for you. Although variables of enum types may be declared, compilers need not check that what you store in such a variable is a valid value for the enumeration. Nevertheless, enumeration variables offer the chance of checking and so are often better than #defines. In addition, a debugger may be able to print values of enumeration variables in their symbolic form.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="declarations"><a class="header" href="#declarations">Declarations</a></h1>
<p>All variables must be declared before use, although certain declarations can be made implicitly by content. A declaration specifies a type, and contains a list of one or more variables of that type, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int lower, upper, step; 
char c, line[1000];
</code></pre>
<p>Variables can be distributed among declarations in any fashion; the lists above could well be written as</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int lower; 
int upper; 
int step; 
char c; 
char line[1000];
</code></pre>
<p>The latter form takes more space, but is convenient for adding a comment to each declaration for subsequent modifications.</p>
<p>A variable may also be initialized in its declaration. If the name is followed by an equals sign and an expression, the expression serves as an initializer, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char esc = '\\'; 
int i = 0; 
int limit = MAXLINE+1; 
float eps = 1.0e-5;
</code></pre>
<p>If the variable in question is not automatic, the initialization is done once only, conceptionally before the program starts executing, and the initializer must be a constant expression. An explicitly initialized automatic variable is initialized each time the function or block it is in is entered; the initializer may be any expression. External and static variables are initialized to zero by default. Automatic variables for which there is no explicit initializer have undefined (i.e., garbage) values.</p>
<p>The qualifier <em>const</em> can be applied to the declaration of any variable to specify that its value will not be changed. For an array, the const qualifier says that the elements will not be altered.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">const double e = 2.71828182845905; 
const char msg[] = "warning: ";
</code></pre>
<p>The const declaration can also be used with array arguments, to indicate that the function does not change that array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int strlen(const char[]);
</code></pre>
<p>The result is implementation-defined if an attempt is made to change a const.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="arithmetic-operators"><a class="header" href="#arithmetic-operators">Arithmetic Operators</a></h1>
<p>The binary arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /, and the modulus operator %. Integer division truncates any fractional part. The expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x % y 
</code></pre>
<p>produces the remainder when x is divided by y, and thus is zero when y divides x exactly. For example, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except that years divisible by 400 <em>are</em> leap years. Therefore:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if ((year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0) 
    printf("%d is a leap year\n", year); 
else 
    printf("%d is not a leap year\n", year);
</code></pre>
<p>The % operator cannot be applied to a float or double. The direction of truncation for / and the sign of the result for % are machine-dependent for negative operands, as is the action taken on overflow or underflow.</p>
<p>The binary + and - operators have the same precedence, which is lower than the precedence of *, / and %, which is in turn lower than unary + and -. Arithmetic operators associate left to right.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter2/../Chapter2/2-12.html">Table 2.1</a> at the end of this chapter summarizes precedence and associativity for all operators.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="relational-and-logical-operators"><a class="header" href="#relational-and-logical-operators">Relational and Logical Operators</a></h1>
<p>The relational operators are</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">&gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;=
</code></pre>
<p>They all have the same precedence. Just below them in precedence are the equality operators:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">== != 
</code></pre>
<p>Relational operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators, so an expression like</p>
<p><code>i &lt; lim-1</code> is taken as <code>i &lt; (lim-1)</code>, as would be expected.</p>
<p>More interesting are the logical operators &amp;&amp; and ||. Expressions connected by &amp;&amp; or || are evaluated left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the truth or falsehood of the result is known. Most C programs rely on these properties. For example, here is a loop from the input function getline that we wrote in <a href="Chapter2/../Chapter1/1-9.html">Chapter 1</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (i=0; i &lt; lim-1 &amp;&amp; (c=getchar()) != '\n' &amp;&amp; c != EOF; ++i) 
    s[i] = c;
</code></pre>
<p>Before reading a new character it is necessary to check that there is room to store it in the array s, so the test i &lt; lim-1 <em>must</em> be made first. Moreover, if this test fails, we must not go on and read another character.</p>
<p>Similarly, it would be unfortunate if c were tested against EOF before getchar is called; therefore the call and assignment must occur before the character in c is tested.</p>
<p>The precedence of &amp;&amp; is higher than that of ||, and both are lower than relational and equality operators, so expressions like</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">i &lt; lim-1 &amp;&amp; (c=getchar()) != '\n' &amp;&amp; c != EOF 
</code></pre>
<p>need no extra parentheses. But since the precedence of != is higher than assignment, parentheses <em>are</em> needed in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">(c=getchar()) != '\n'
</code></pre>
<p>to achieve the desired result of assignment to c and then comparison with <code>\n</code>.</p>
<p>By definition, the numeric value of a relational or logical expression is 1 if the relation is true, and 0 if the relation is false.</p>
<p>The unary negation operator ! converts a non-zero operand into 0, and a zero operand in 1. A common use of ! is in constructions like</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (!valid) 
</code></pre>
<p>rather than</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (valid == 0)
</code></pre>
<p>It's hard to generalize about which form is better. Constructions like !valid read nicely ("if not valid"), but more complicated ones can be hard to understand.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter2/../Solutions/Chapter2/E2-2.html"><strong>Exercise 2-2.</strong></a> Write a loop equivalent to the for loop above without using &amp;&amp; or ||.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="type-conversions"><a class="header" href="#type-conversions">Type Conversions</a></h1>
<p>When an operator has operands of different types, they are converted to a common type according to a small number of rules. In general, the only automatic conversions are those that convert a "narrower" operand into a "wider" one without losing information, such as converting an integer into floating point in an expression like f + i. Expressions that don't make sense, like using a float as a subscript, are disallowed. Expressions that might lose information, like assigning a longer integer type to a shorter, or a floating-point type to an integer, may draw a warning, but they are not illegal.</p>
<p>A char is just a small integer, so chars may be freely used in arithmetic expressions. This permits considerable flexibility in certain kinds of character transformations. One is exemplified by this naive implementation of the function <em>atoi</em>, which converts a string of digits into its numeric equivalent.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* atoi: convert s to integer */ 
int atoi(char s[]) { 

    int i, n; 

    n = 0; 
    for (i = 0; s[i] &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; s[i] &lt;= '9'; ++i) 
        n = 10 * n + (s[i] - '0'); 
    return n; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>As we discussed in <a href="Chapter2/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a>, the expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">s[i] - '0'
</code></pre>
<p>gives the numeric value of the character stored in s[i], because the values of '0', '1', etc., form a contiguous increasing sequence.</p>
<p>Another example of char to int conversion is the function <em>lower</em>, which maps a single character to lower case <em>for the ASCII character set</em>. If the character is not an upper case letter, lower returns it unchanged.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* lower: convert c to lower case; ASCII only */ 
int lower(int c) { 

    if (c &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z') 
        return c + 'a' - 'A'; 
    else 
        return c; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works for ASCII because corresponding upper case and lower case letters are a fixed distance apart as numeric values and each alphabet is contiguous - there is nothing but letters between A and Z. This latter observation is not true of the EBCDIC character set, however, so this code would convert more than just letters in EBCDIC.</p>
<p>The standard header <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code>, described in Appendix B, defines a family of functions that provide tests and conversions that are independent of character set. For example, the function <em>tolower</em> is a portable replacement for the function <em>lower</em> shown above. Similarly, the test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">c &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9' 
</code></pre>
<p>can be replaced by:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">isdigit(c)
</code></pre>
<p>We will use the <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code> functions from now on.</p>
<p>There is one subtle point about the conversion of characters to integers. The language does not specify whether variables of type char are signed or unsigned quantities. When a char is converted to an int, can it ever produce a negative integer? The answer varies from machine to machine, reflecting differences in architecture. On some machines a char whose leftmost bit is 1 will be converted to a negative integer ("sign extension"). On others, a char is promoted to an int by adding zeros at the left end, and thus is always positive.</p>
<p>The definition of C guarantees that any character in the machine's standard printing character set will never be negative, so these characters will always be positive quantities in expressions. But arbitrary bit patterns stored in character variables may appear to be negative on some machines, yet positive on others. For portability, specify signed or unsigned if noncharacter data is to be stored in char variables.</p>
<p>Relational expressions like i &gt; j and logical expressions connected by &amp;&amp; and || are defined to have value 1 if true, and 0 if false. Thus the assignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">d = c &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9'
</code></pre>
<p>sets d to 1 if c is a digit, and 0 if not. However, functions like <em>isdigit</em> may return any nonzero value for true. In the test part of if, while, for, etc., "true" just means "non-zero", so this makes no difference.</p>
<p>Implicit arithmetic conversions work much as expected. In general, if an operator like + or * that takes two operands (a binary operator) has operands of different types, the "lower" type is <em>promoted</em> to the "higher" type before the operation proceeds. The result is of the integer type. <a href="Chapter2/../AppendixA/A6-0.html">Section 6 of Appendix A</a> states the conversion rules precisely. If there are no unsigned operands, however, the following informal set of rules will suffice:</p>
<ul>
<li>If either operand is long double, convert the other to long double.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if either operand is double, convert the other to double.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if either operand is float, convert the other to float.</li>
<li>Otherwise, convert char and short to int.</li>
<li>Then, if either operand is long, convert the other to long.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that floats in an expression are not automatically converted to double; this is a change from the original definition. In general, mathematical functions like those in <code>&lt;math.h&gt;</code> will use double precision. The main reason for using float is to save storage in large arrays, or, less often, to save time on machines where double-precision arithmetic is particularly expensive.</p>
<p>Conversion rules are more complicated when unsigned operands are involved. The problem is that comparisons between signed and unsigned values are machine-dependent, because they depend on the sizes of the various integer types. For example, suppose that int is 16 bits and long is 32 bits. Then -1L &lt; 1U, because 1U, which is an unsigned int, is promoted to a signed long. But -1L &gt; 1UL because -1L is promoted to unsigned long and thus appears to be a large positive number.</p>
<p>Conversions take place across assignments; the value of the right side is converted to the type of the left, which is the type of the result.</p>
<p>A character is converted to an integer, either by sign extension or not, as described above.</p>
<p>Longer integers are converted to shorter ones or to chars by dropping the excess high-order bits. Thus in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int i; 
char c; 
i = c; 
c = i;
</code></pre>
<p>the value of c is unchanged. This is true whether or not sign extension is involved. Reversing the order of assignments might lose information, however.</p>
<p>If x is float and i is int, then x = i and i = x both cause conversions; float to int causes truncation of any fractional part. When a double is converted to float, whether the value is rounded or truncated is implementation dependent.</p>
<p>Since an argument of a function call is an expression, type conversion also takes place when arguments are passed to functions. In the absence of a function prototype, char and short become int, and float becomes double. This is why we have declared function arguments to be int and double even when the function is called with char and float.</p>
<p>Finally, explicit type conversions can be forced ("coerced") in any expression, with a unary operator called a cast. In the construction</p>
<pre><code>(*type name*) *expression*
</code></pre>
<p>the <em>expression</em> is converted to the named type by the conversion rules above. The precise meaning of a cast is as if the <em>expression</em> were assigned to a variable of the specified type, which is then used in place of the whole construction. For example, the library routine <em>sqrt</em> expects a double argument, and will produce nonsense if inadvertently handed something else. (sqrt is declared in <code>&lt;math.h&gt;</code>.) So if n is an integer, we can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">sqrt((double) n)
</code></pre>
<p>to convert the value of n to double before passing it to sqrt. Note that the cast produces the <em>value</em> of n in the proper type; n itself is not altered. The cast operator has the same high precedence as other unary operators, as summarized in the table at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>If arguments are declared by a function prototype, as they normally should be, the declaration causes automatic coercion of any arguments when the function is called. Thus, given a function prototype for sqrt:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">double sqrt(double) 
</code></pre>
<p>the call:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">root2 = sqrt(2) 
</code></pre>
<p>coerces the integer 2 into the double value 2.0 without any need for a cast.</p>
<p>The standard library includes a portable implementation of a pseudo-random number generator and a function for initializing the seed; the former illustrates a cast:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">unsigned long int next = 1; 
/* rand: return pseudo-random integer on 0..32767 */ 

int rand(void) { 

    next = next * 1103515245 + 12345; 
    return (unsigned int)(next/65536) % 32768; 
} 

/* srand: set seed for rand() */ 
void srand(unsigned int seed) { 

    next = seed; 
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="Chapter2/../Solutions/Chapter2/E2-3.html"><strong>Exercise 2-3.</strong></a> Write a function <code>htoi(s)</code>, which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer value.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="increment-and-decrement-operators"><a class="header" href="#increment-and-decrement-operators">Increment and Decrement Operators</a></h1>
<p>C provides two unusual operators for incrementing and decrementing variables. The increment operator <code>++</code> adds 1 to its operand, while the decrement operator <code>--</code> subtracts 1. We have frequently used <code>++</code> to increment variables, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (c == '\n') ++nl;
</code></pre>
<p>The unusual aspect is that <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> may be used either as prefix operators (before the variable, as in ++n), or postfix operators (after the variable: n++). In both cases, the effect is to increment n. But the expression ++n increments n <em>before</em> its value is used, while n++ increments n <em>after</em> its value has been used. This means that in a context where the value is being used, not just the effect, ++n and n++ are different. If n is 5, then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x = n++; 
</code></pre>
<p>sets x to 5, but:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x = ++n;
</code></pre>
<p>sets x to 6. In both cases, n becomes 6. The increment and decrement operators can only be applied to variables; an expression like <code>(i+j)++</code> is illegal.</p>
<p>In a context where no value is wanted, just the incrementing effect, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (c == '\n') 
    nl++;
</code></pre>
<p>prefix and postfix are the same. But there are situations where one or the other is specifically called for. For instance, consider the function <code>squeeze(s,c)</code>, which removes all occurrences of the character c from the string s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* squeeze: delete all c from s */ 
void squeeze(char s[], int c) { 

    int i, j; 

    for (i = j = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) 
        if (s[i] != c) 
            s[j++] = s[i]; 

    s[j] = '\0'; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each time a non-c occurs, it is copied into the current j position, and only then is j incremented to be ready for the next character. This is exactly equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (s[i] != c) { 
    s[j] = s[i]; 
    j++; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another example of a similar construction comes from the <code>getline</code> function that we wrote in Chapter 1, where we can replace</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (c == '\n') { 
    s[i] = c; 
    ++i; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>by the more compact</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (c == '\n') 
    s[i++] = c;
</code></pre>
<p>As a third example, consider the standard function <code>strcat(s,t)</code>, which concatenates the string t to the end of string s. <code>strcat</code> assumes that there is enough space in s to hold the combination. As we have written it, <code>strcat</code> returns no value; the standard library version returns a pointer to the resulting string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strcat: concatenate t to end of s; s must be big enough */ 
void strcat(char s[], char t[]) {
    
    int i, j; 
    i = j = 0; 
    while (s[i] != '\0') /* find end of s */ 
        i++; 
    while ((s[i++] = t[j++]) != '\0') /* copy t */ 
        ; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>As each member is copied from t to s, the postfix ++ is applied to both i and j to make sure that they are in position for the next pass through the loop.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter2/../Solutions/Chapter2/E2-4.html"><strong>Exercise 2-4.</strong></a> Write an alternative version of squeeze(s1,s2) that deletes each character in s1 that matches any character in the <em>string</em> s2.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bitwise-operators"><a class="header" href="#bitwise-operators">Bitwise Operators</a></h1>
<p>C provides six operators for bit manipulation; these may only be applied to integral operands, that is, char, short, int, and long, whether signed or unsigned.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>&amp;</td><td>bitwise AND</td></tr>
<tr><td>|</td><td>bitwise inclusive OR</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td>bitwise exclusive OR</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;&lt;</td><td>left shift</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;&gt;</td><td>right shift</td></tr>
<tr><td>~</td><td>one's complement (unary)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The bitwise AND operator (&amp;) is often used to mask off some set of bits, for example</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">n = n &amp; 0177; 
</code></pre>
<p>sets to zero all but the low-order 7 bits of n.</p>
<p>The bitwise OR operator | is used to turn bits on:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x = x | SET_ON; 
</code></pre>
<p>sets to one in x the bits that are set to one in SET_ON.</p>
<p>The bitwise exclusive OR operator ^ sets a one in each bit position where its operands have different bits, and zero where they are the same.</p>
<p>One must distinguish the bitwise operators &amp; and | from the logical operators &amp;&amp; and ||, which imply left-to-right evaluation of a truth value. For example, if x is 1 and y is 2, then x &amp; y is zero while x &amp;&amp; y is one.</p>
<p>The shift operators &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; perform left and right shifts of their left operand by the number of bit positions given by the right operand, which must be non-negative. Thus x &lt;&lt; 2 shifts the value of x by two positions, filling vacated bits with zero; this is equivalent to multiplication by 4. Right shifting an unsigned quantity always fits the vacated bits with zero. Right shifting a signed quantity will fill with bit signs ("arithmetic shift") on some machines and with 0-bits ("logical shift") on others.</p>
<p>The unary operator ~ yields the one's complement of an integer; that is, it converts each 1-bit into a 0-bit and vice versa. For example</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x = x &amp; ~077
</code></pre>
<p>sets the last six bits of x to zero. Note that x &amp; ~077 is independent of word length, and is thus preferable to, for example, x &amp; 0177700, which assumes that x is a 16-bit quantity. The portable form involves no extra cost, since ~077 is a constant expression that can be evaluated at compile time.</p>
<p>As an illustration of some of the bit operators, consider the function <code>getbits(x,p,n)</code> that returns the (right adjusted) n-bit field of x that begins at position p. We assume that bit position 0 is at the right end and that n and p are sensible positive values. For example, <code>getbits(x,4,3)</code> returns the three bits in positions 4, 3 and 2, right-adjusted.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* getbits: get n bits from position p */ 
unsigned getbits(unsigned x, int p, int n) { 

    return (x &gt;&gt; (p+1-n)) &amp; ~(~0 &lt;&lt; n); 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The expression x &gt;&gt; (p+1-n) moves the desired field to the right end of the word. ~0 is all 1-bits; shifting it left n positions with ~0&lt;&lt;n places zeros in the rightmost n bits; complementing that with ~ makes a mask with ones in the rightmost n bits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
If that confused you, it confused me too. So let's go step by step.</p>
<p>Imagine we have a number; say 37. in binary that would be: <code>100101</code><br />
(most significant bit first, the lowest bit on the right)</p>
<p>We would like to have bits 2 and 1, so p = 2 and n = 2.<br />
(We start counting from 0, that's why the position is 2 instead of 3, and p determines the upper bound, we count n down from there)</p>
<p>Original number: <code>100101</code></p>
<p><code>x &gt;&gt; (p+1-n)</code>results in <code>x &gt;&gt; (1)</code><br />
So we shift all digits 1 position to the right, dropping the rightmost digit.</p>
<p>After shift: <code>010010</code></p>
<p><code>~(~0 &lt;&lt; n)</code>constructs a mask like this:</p>
<p><code>~0</code> turns <code>000000</code>into <code>111111</code>(however many zeros we want, deduced at compile-time) then:<br />
<code>&lt;&lt; n </code>shifts them left by n (in our case 2) places, resulting in: <code>111100</code><br />
the final <code>~</code> inverts it leaving: <code>000011</code></p>
<p>then we AND our shifted input and the mask together, which results in:
<code>000010</code></p>
<p>I included a little example program so you can check that out too.</p>

<p>An expression such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">i = i + 2
</code></pre>
<p>in which the variable on the left side is repeated immediately on the right, can be written in the compressed form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">i += 2
</code></pre>
<p>The operator <code>+=</code> is called an <em>assignment operator</em>.</p>
<p>Most binary operators (operators like <code>+</code> that have a left and right operand) have a corresponding assignment operator <code>op=</code>, where <em>op</em> is one of</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">+ - * / % &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; &amp; ^ | 
</code></pre>
<p>If <em>expr1</em> and <em>expr2</em> are expressions, then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">expr1 op= expr2
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*expr1* = (*expr1*) *op* (*expr2*) 
</code></pre>
<p>except that <em>expr1</em> is computed only once. Notice the parentheses around <em>expr2</em>:</p>
<p><code>x *= y + 1</code> means <code>x = x * (y + 1)</code> rather than <code>x = x * y + 1</code></p>
<p>As an example, the function bitcount counts the number of 1-bits in its integer argument.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* bitcount: count 1 bits in x */ 
int bitcount(unsigned x) { 

    int b; 

    for (b = 0; x != 0; x &gt;&gt;= 1) 
        if (x &amp; 01) 
            b++; 
    return b; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Declaring the argument x to be unsigned (int) ensures that when it is right-shifted, vacated bits will be filled with zeros, not sign bits, regardless of the machine the program is run on.</p>
<p>Quite apart from conciseness, assignment operators have the advantage that they correspond better to the way people think. We say "add 2 to i" or "increment i by 2", not "take i, add 2, then put the result back in i". Thus the expression <code>i += 2</code> is preferable to <code>i = i+2</code>. In addition, for a complicated expression like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">yyval[yypv[p3+p4] + yypv[p1]] += 2
</code></pre>
<p>the assignment operator makes the code easier to understand, since the reader doesn't have to check painstakingly that two long expressions are indeed the same, or to wonder why they're not. And an assignment operator may even help a compiler to produce efficient code.</p>
<p>We have already seen that the assignment statement has a value and can occur in expressions; the most common example is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) 
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>The other assignment operators (<code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, etc.) can also occur in expressions, although this is less frequent.</p>
<p>In all such expressions, the type of an assignment expression is the type of its left operand, and the value is the value after the assignment.</p>

<p>The statements</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (a &gt; b) 
    z = a; 
else 
    z = b;
</code></pre>
<p>compute in z the maximum of a and b. The <em>conditional expression</em>, written with the ternary operator <code>?:</code>, provides an alternate way to write this and similar constructions. In the expression:</p>
<p><code>expr1 ? expr2 : expr3</code></p>
<p>the expression <em>expr1</em> is evaluated first. If it is non-zero (true), then the expression <em>expr2</em> is
evaluated, and that is the value of the conditional expression. Otherwise <em>expr3</em> is evaluated,
and that is the value. Only one of <em>expr2</em> and <em>expr3</em> is evaluated. Thus to set z to the maximum
of a and b;</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">z = (a &gt; b) ? a : b; /* z = max(a, b) */ 
</code></pre>
<p>It should be noted that the conditional expression is indeed an expression, and it can be used
wherever any other expression can be. If <em>expr2</em> and <em>expr3</em> are of different types, the type of the
result is determined by the conversion rules discussed earlier in this chapter. For example, if f
is a float and n an int, then the expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">(n &gt; 0) ? f : n 
</code></pre>
<p>is of type float regardless of whether n is positive.</p>
<p>Parentheses are not necessary around the first expression of a conditional expression, since the precedence of <code>?:</code> is very low, just above assignment. They are advisable anyway, however, since they make the condition part of the expression easier to see.</p>
<p>The conditional expression often leads to succinct code. For example, this loop prints n elements of an array, 10 per line, with each column separated by one blank, and with each line (including the last) terminated by a newline.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
    printf("%6d%c", a[i], (i%10==9 || i==n-1) ? '\n' : ' ');
</code></pre>
<p>A newline is printed after every tenth element, and after the n-th. All other elements are followed by one blank. This might look tricky, but it's more compact than the equivalent if-else. Another good example is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("You have %d item%s.\n", n, n==1 ? "" : "s");

<p>Unary <code>&amp;</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>*</code> have higher precedence than the binary forms.</p>
<p>Note that the precedence of the bitwise operators <code>&amp;</code>, <code>^</code>, and <code>|</code> falls below <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>. This implies that bit-testing expressions like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if ((x &amp; MASK) == 0) ... 
</code></pre>
<p>must be fully parenthesized to give proper results.</p>
<p>C, like most languages, does not specify the order in which the operands of an operator are evaluated. (The exceptions are <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>?:</code>, and <code>,</code>.) For example, in a statement like</p>
<p><code>x = f() + g();</code></p>
<p>f may be evaluated before g or vice versa; thus if either f or g alters a variable on which the other depends, x can depend on the order of evaluation. Intermediate results can be stored in temporary variables to ensure a particular sequence.</p>
<p>Similarly, the order in which function arguments are evaluated is not specified, so the statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("%d %d\n", ++n, power(2, n)); /* WRONG */ 
</code></pre>
<p>can produce different results with different compilers, depending on whether n is incremented before power is called. The solution, of course, is to write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("%d %d\n", n, power(2, n));
</code></pre>
<p>Function calls, nested assignment statements, and increment and decrement operators cause "side effects" - some variable is changed as a by-product of the evaluation of an expression. In any expression involving side effects, there can be subtle dependencies on the order in which variables taking part in the expression are updated. One unhappy situation is typified by the statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">a[i] = i++;
</code></pre>
<p>The question is whether the subscript is the old value of i or the new. Compilers can interpret this in different ways, and generate different answers depending on their interpretation. The standard intentionally leaves most such matters unspecified. When side effects (assignment to variables) take place within an expression, the order is left to the discretion of the compiler, since the best order depends strongly on machine architecture. (The standard does specify that all side effects on arguments take effect before a function is called, but that would not help in the call to printf above.)</p>
<p>The moral is that writing code that depends on order of evaluation is a bad programming practice in any language. Naturally, it is necessary to know what things to avoid, but if you don't know <em>how</em> they are done on various machines, you won't be tempted to take advantage of a particular implementation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-3---control-flow"><a class="header" href="#chapter-3---control-flow">Chapter 3 - Control Flow</a></h1>
<p>The control-flow of a language specify the order in which computations are performed. We have already met the most common control-flow constructions in earlier examples; here we will complete the set, and be more precise about the ones discussed before.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="statements-and-blocks"><a class="header" href="#statements-and-blocks">Statements and Blocks</a></h1>
<p>An expression such as <code>x = 0</code> or <code>i++</code> or <code>printf(...)</code> becomes a <em>statement</em> when it is followed by a semicolon, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x = 0; 
i++; 
printf(...);
</code></pre>
<p>In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator as it is in languages like Pascal.</p>
<p>Braces <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are used to group declarations and statements together into a <em>compound statement</em>, or <em>block</em>, so that they are syntactically equivalent to a single statement. The braces that surround the statements of a function are one obvious example; braces around multiple statements after an <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>for</code> are another. (Variables can be declared inside <em>any</em> block; we will talk about this in <a href="Chapter3/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a>.) There is <em><strong>no</strong></em> semicolon after the right brace that ends a block.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="if-else"><a class="header" href="#if-else">If-Else</a></h1>
<p>The <code>if-else</code> statement is used to express decisions. Formally the syntax is:</p>
<pre><code>if (expression) 
    statement1
else 
    statement2
</code></pre>
<p>where the <code>else</code> part is optional. The <em>expression</em> is evaluated; if it is true (that is, if <em>expression</em> has a non-zero value), <em>statement1</em> is executed. If it is false (<em>expression</em> is zero) and if there is an <code>else</code> part, <em>statement2</em> is executed instead.</p>
<p>Since an <code>if</code> tests the numeric value of an expression, certain coding shortcuts are possible. The most obvious is writing:</p>
<p><code>if (expression) </code></p>
<p>instead of:</p>
<p><code>if (expression != 0) </code></p>
<p>Sometimes this is natural and clear; at other times it can be cryptic.</p>
<p>Because the <code>else</code> part of an <code>if-else</code> is optional, there is an ambiguity when an <code>else</code> is omitted from a nested <code>if</code> sequence. This is resolved by associating the <code>else</code> with the closest previous <code>else</code>-less <code>if</code>. For example, in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (n &gt; 0) 
    if (a &gt; b) 
        z = a; 
    else 
        z = b;
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>else</code> goes to the inner <code>if</code>, as we have shown by indentation. If that isn't what you want, braces must be used to force the proper association:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (n &gt; 0) { 
    if (a &gt; b) 
         z = a; 
} 
else 
    z = b;
</code></pre>
<p>The ambiguity is especially pernicious in situations like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (n &gt; 0) 
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
        if (s[i] &gt; 0) { 
            printf("..."); 
            return i; 
        } 
else /* WRONG */ 
    printf("error -- n is negative\n");
</code></pre>
<p>The indentation shows unequivocally what you want, but the compiler doesn't get the message, and associates the <code>else</code> with the inner <code>if</code>. This kind of bug can be hard to find; it's a good idea to use braces when there are nested <code>if</code>s.</p>
<p>By the way, notice that there is a semicolon after <code>z = a</code> in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (a &gt; b) 
    z = a; 
else 
    z = b;
</code></pre>
<p>This is because grammatically, a <em>statement</em> follows the <code>if</code>, and an expression statement like "z = a;" is always terminated by a semicolon.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="else-if"><a class="header" href="#else-if">Else-If</a></h1>
<p>The construction:</p>
<pre><code>if (expression) 
    statement
else if (expression) 
    statement
else if (expression) 
    statement
else if (expression) 
    statement
else 
    statement
</code></pre>
<p>occurs so often that it is worth a brief separate discussion. This sequence of <code>if</code>-statements is the most general way of writing a multi-way decision. The <em>expressions</em> are evaluated in order; if an <em>expression</em> is true, the <em>statement</em> associated with it is executed, and this terminates the whole chain. As always, the code for each <em>statement</em> is either a single statement, or a group of them in braces.</p>
<p>The last <code>else</code> part handles the "none of the above" or default case where none of the other conditions is satisfied. Sometimes there is no explicit action for the default; in that case the trailing
<code>else</code> <em>statement</em> can be omitted, or it may be used for error checking to catch an "impossible" condition.</p>
<p>To illustrate a three-way decision, here is a binary search function that decides if a particular value <code>x</code> occurs in the sorted array <code>v</code>. The elements of <code>v</code> <em>must</em> be in increasing order. The function returns the position (a number between 0 and n-1) if <code>x</code> occurs in <code>v</code>, and -1 if not.</p>
<p>Binary search first compares the input value <code>x</code> to the middle element of the array <code>v</code>. If <code>x</code> is less than the middle value, searching focuses on the lower half of the table, otherwise on the upper half. In either case, the next step is to compare <code>x</code> to the middle element of the selected half. This process of dividing the range in two continues until the value is found or the range is empty.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* binsearch: find x in v[0] &lt;= v[1] &lt;= ... &lt;= v[n-1] */ 
int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n) {

    int low, high, mid; 

    low = 0; 
    high = n - 1; 
    while (low &lt;= high) { 

        mid = (low + high) / 2; 

        if (x &lt; v[mid]) 
            high = mid - 1; 
        else if (x &gt; v[mid]) 
            low = mid + 1; 
        else /* found match */ 
            return mid; 
    } 
    return -1; /* no match */ 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The fundamental decision is whether <code>x</code> is less than, greater than, or equal to the middle element <code>v[mid]</code> at each step; this is a natural for <code>else-if</code>.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter3/../Solutions/Chapter3/E3-1.html"><strong>Exercise 3-1.</strong></a> Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice (at the price of more tests outside.) Write a version with only one test inside the loop and measure the difference in run-time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="switch"><a class="header" href="#switch">Switch</a></h1>
<p>The <code>switch</code> statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an expression matches one of a number of <em>constant</em> integer values, and branches accordingly.</p>
<pre><code>switch (expression) { 
    case const-expr: statements
    case const-expr: statements
    default: statements
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each case is labeled by one or more integer-valued constants or constant expressions. If a case matches the expression value, execution starts at that case. All case expressions must be different. The case labeled <code>default</code> is executed if none of the other cases are satisfied. A <code>default</code> is optional; if it isn't there and if none of the cases match, no action at all takes place. Cases and the default clause can occur in any order.</p>
<p>In <a href="Chapter3/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a> we wrote a program to count the occurrences of each digit, white space, and all other characters, using a sequence of <code>if ... else if ... else</code>. Here is the same program with a <code>switch</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* count digits, white space, others */
main() { 

    int c, i, nwhite, nother, ndigit[10]; 

    nwhite = nother = 0; 

    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) 
        ndigit[i] = 0; 

    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) { 

        switch (c) { 
            case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4': 
            case '5': case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9': 
                ndigit[c-'0']++; 
                break; 
            case ' ': 
            case '\n': 
            case '\t': 
                nwhite++; 
                break; 
            default: 
                nother++; 
                break; 
        } 
    } 

    printf("digits ="); 

    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) 
        printf(" %d", ndigit[i]); 

    printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n", nwhite, nother); 

    return 0; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>break</code> statement causes an immediate exit from the <code>switch</code>. Because cases serve just as labels, after the code for one case is done, execution <em>falls through</em> to the next unless you take explicit action to escape. <code>break</code> and <code>return</code> are the most common ways to leave a <code>switch</code>. A <code>break</code> statement can also be used to force an immediate exit from <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>do</code> loops, as will be discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Falling through cases is a mixed blessing. On the positive side, it allows several cases to be attached to a single action, as with the digits in this example. But it also implies that normally each <code>case</code> must end with a <code>break</code> to prevent falling through to the next. Falling through from one case to another is not robust, being prone to disintegration when the program is modified. With the exception of multiple labels for a single computation, fall-throughs should be used sparingly, and commented.</p>
<p>As a matter of good form, put a break after the last case (the <code>default</code> here) even though it's logically unnecessary. Some day when another case gets added at the end, this bit of defensive programming will save you.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter3/../Solutions/Chapter3/E3-2.html"><strong>Exercise 3-2.</strong></a> Write a function <code>escape(s,t)</code> that converts characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like <code>\n</code> and <code>\t</code> as it copies the string <code>t</code> to <code>s</code>.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="loops---while-and-for"><a class="header" href="#loops---while-and-for">Loops - While and For</a></h1>
<p>We have already encountered the <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops. In:</p>
<p><code>while (expression)      statement</code></p>
<p>the <em>expression</em> is evaluated. If it is non-zero, <em>statement</em> is executed and <em>expression</em> is reevaluated. This cycle continues until <em>expression</em> becomes zero, at which point execution resumes after <em>statement</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>for</code> statement:</p>
<p><code>for (expr1; expr2; expr3)      statement</code></p>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<p><code>expr1;  while (expr2) {      statement     expr3;  }</code></p>
<p>except for the behaviour of <code>continue</code>, which is described in <a href="Chapter3/3-7.html">Section 3.7</a>.</p>
<p>Grammatically, the three components of a <code>for</code> loop are expressions. Most commonly, <em>expr1</em> and <em>expr3</em> are assignments or function calls and <em>expr2</em> is a relational expression. Any of the three parts can be omitted, although the semicolons must remain. If <em>expr1</em> or <em>expr3</em> is omitted, it is simply dropped from the expansion. If the test, <em>expr2</em>, is not present, it is taken as permanently true, so</p>
<p><code>for (;;) { ... }</code></p>
<p>is an "infinite" loop, presumably to be broken by other means, such as a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code>.</p>
<p>Whether to use <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> is largely a matter of personal preference. For example, in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">while ((c = getchar()) == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t') 
    ; /* skip white space characters */     
</code></pre>
<p>there is no initialization or re-initialization, so the while is most natural.</p>
<p>The <code>for</code> is preferable when there is a simple initialization and increment since it keeps the loop control statements close together and visible at the top of the loop. This is most obvious in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>which is the C idiom for processing the first <code>n</code> elements of an array, the analog of the Fortran <code>DO</code> loop or the Pascal <code>for</code>. The analogy is not perfect, however, since the index variable <code>i</code> retains its value when the loop terminates for any reason. Because the components of the <code>for</code> are arbitrary expressions, <code>for</code> loops are not restricted to arithmetic progressions. Nonetheless, it is bad style to force unrelated computations into the initialization and increment of a for, which are better reserved for loop control operations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em></p>
<p>They mention <code>i</code> retains its value after the loop, this is only partly true nowadays. Consider these 2 scenarios:</p>
<h4 id="scenario-1"><a class="header" href="#scenario-1">Scenario 1:</a></h4>
<pre><code class="language-c">int i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
  ...
</code></pre>
<h4 id="scenario-2"><a class="header" href="#scenario-2">Scenario 2:</a></h4>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>In Scenario 1, <code>i</code> is declared outside of the loop, so even after the loop finishes, <code>i</code> is accessible (and thus its value persists).<br />
In Scenario 2 however, <code>i</code> is part of the <code>for</code> loop and so it goes "out of scope" once the loop finishes, that is; it is local to the loop.</p>
<p>Whether or not you need (the value of) <code>i</code> to persist depends on your use case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a larger example, here is another version of <code>atoi</code> for converting a string to its numeric equivalent. This one is slightly more general than the one in <a href="Chapter3/../Chapter2/2-0.html">Chapter 2</a>; it copes with optional leading white space and an optional <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> sign. (<a href="Chapter3/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a> shows <code>atof</code>, which does the same conversion for floating-point numbers.)</p>
<p>The structure of the program reflects the form of the input:</p>
<pre><code>skip white space, if any   
get sign, if any   
get integer part and convert it
</code></pre>
<p>Each step does its part, and leaves things in a clean state for the next. The whole process terminates on the first character that could not be part of a number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;ctype.h&gt; 

/* atoi: convert s to integer; version 2 */ 
int atoi(char s[]) { 

    int i, n, sign; 

    for (i = 0; isspace(s[i]); i++) /* skip white space */ 
        ; 

    sign = (s[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;

    if (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-') /* skip sign */ 
        i++; 

    for (n = 0; isdigit(s[i]); i++) 
        n = 10 * n + (s[i] - '0'); 

    return sign * n; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The standard library provides a more elaborate function <code>strtol</code> for conversion of strings to long integers; see Section 5 of <a href="Chapter3/../AppendixB/B0.html">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>The advantages of keeping loop control centralized are even more obvious when there are several nested loops. The following function is a Shell sort for sorting an array of integers. The basic idea of this sorting algorithm, which was invented in 1959 by D. L. Shell, is that in early stages, far-apart elements are compared, rather than adjacent ones as in simpler interchange sorts. This tends to eliminate large amounts of disorder quickly, so later stages have less work to do. The interval between compared elements is gradually decreased to one, at which point the sort effectively becomes an adjacent interchange method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* shellsort: sort v[0]...v[n-1] into increasing order */ 
void shellsort(int v[], int n) {

    int gap, i, j, temp; 
    for (gap = n/2; gap &gt; 0; gap /= 2) 
        for (i = gap; i &lt; n; i++) 
            for (j = i - gap; j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; v[j] &gt; v[j + gap]; j -= gap) { 
                temp = v[j]; 
                v[j] = v[j + gap]; 
                v[j + gap] = temp; 
            }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are three nested loops. The outermost controls the gap between compared elements, shrinking it from <code>n/2</code> by a factor of two each pass until it becomes zero. The middle loop steps along the elements. The innermost loop compares each pair of elements that is separated by gap and reverses any that are out of order. Since gap is eventually reduced to one, all elements are eventually ordered correctly. Notice how the generality of the <code>for</code> makes the outer loop fit in the same form as the others, even though it is not an arithmetic progression.</p>
<p>One final C operator is the comma <code>,</code> , which most often finds use in the <code>for</code> statement. A pair of expressions separated by a comma is evaluated left to right, and the type and value of the result are the type and value of the right operand. Thus in a <code>for</code> statement, it is possible to place multiple expressions in the various parts, for example to process two indices in parallel. This is illustrated in the function <code>reverse(s)</code>, which reverses the string <code>s</code> in place.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;string.h&gt; 

/* reverse: reverse string s in place */ 
void reverse(char s[]) { 

    int c, i, j; 
    for (i = 0, j = strlen(s)-1; i &lt; j; i++, j--) { 
        c = s[i]; 
        s[i] = s[j]; 
        s[j] = c; 
    } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The commas that separate function arguments, variables in declarations, etc., are <em>not</em> comma operators, and do not guarantee left to right evaluation.</p>
<p>Comma operators should be used sparingly. The most suitable uses are for constructs strongly related to each other, as in the <code>for</code> loop in <code>reverse</code>, and in macros where a multi step computation has to be a single expression. A comma expression might also be appropriate for the exchange of elements in <code>reverse</code>, where the exchange can be thought of a single operation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (i = 0, j = strlen(s)-1; i &lt; j; i++, j--) 
    c = s[i], s[i] = s[j], s[j] = c;

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="loops---do-while"><a class="header" href="#loops---do-while">Loops - Do-While</a></h1>
<p>As we discussed in <a href="Chapter3/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a>, the <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops test the termination condition at the top. By contrast, the third loop in C, the <code>do-while</code>, tests at the bottom <em>after</em> making each pass through the loop body; the body is always executed at least once.</p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>do</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>do 
    *statement* 
while (*expression*);
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>statement</em> is executed, then <em>expression</em> is evaluated. If it is true, <em>statement</em> is evaluated again, and so on. When the expression becomes false, the loop terminates. Except for the sense of the test, <code>do-while</code> is equivalent to the Pascal <code>repeat-until</code> statement.</p>
<p>Experience shows that <code>do-while</code> is much less used than <code>while</code> and <code>for</code>. Nonetheless, from time to time it is valuable, as in the following function <code>itoa</code>, which converts a number to a character string (the inverse of <code>atoi</code>). The job is slightly more complicated than might be thought at first, because the easy methods of generating the digits generate them in the wrong order. We have chosen to generate the string backwards, then reverse it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* itoa: convert n to characters in s */ 
void itoa(int n, char s[]) { 

    int i, sign; 

    if ((sign = n) &lt; 0) /* record sign */ 
        n = -n; /* make n positive */ 
    
    i = 0; 
    do { /* generate digits in reverse order */ 
        s[i++] = n % 10 + '0'; /* get next digit */ 
    } while ((n /= 10) &gt; 0); /* delete it */ 

    if (sign &lt; 0) 
        s[i++] = '-'; 
    s[i] = '\0'; 

    reverse(s); 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>do-while</code> is necessary, or at least convenient, since at least one character must be installed in the array <code>s</code>, even if <code>n</code> is zero. We also used braces around the single statement that makes up the body of the <code>do-while</code>, even though they are unnecessary, so the hasty reader will not mistake the while part for the <em>beginning</em> of a <code>while</code> loop.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter3/../Solutions/Chapter3/E3-4.html"><strong>Exercise 3-4.</strong></a> In a two's complement number representation, our version of <code>itoa</code> does not handle the largest negative number, that is, the value of <code>n</code> equal to -(2^(wordsize-1)).

<p>It is sometimes convenient to be able to exit from a loop other than by testing at the top or bottom. The <code>break</code> statement provides an early exit from <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do</code>, just as from <code>switch</code>. A <code>break</code> causes the innermost enclosing loop or <code>switch</code> to be exited immediately.</p>
<p>The following function, <code>trim</code>, removes trailing blanks, tabs and newlines from the end of a string, using a <code>break</code> to exit from a loop when the rightmost non-blank, non-tab, non-newline is found.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* trim: remove trailing blanks, tabs, newlines */ 
int trim(char s[]) 
{ 
    int n; 
    for (n = strlen(s) - 1; n &gt;= 0; n--) 
    {
        if (s[n] != ' ' &amp;&amp; s[n] != '\t' &amp;&amp; s[n] != '\n') 
            break; 
    }
    s[n + 1] = '\0'; 
    return n; 
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>strlen</code> returns the length of the string. The <code>for</code> loop starts at the end and scans backwards looking for the first character that is not a blank or tab or newline. The loop is broken when one is found, or when n becomes negative (that is, when the entire string has been scanned). You should verify that this is correct behavior even when the string is empty or contains only white space characters.</p>
<p>The <code>continue</code> statement is related to break, but less often used; it causes the next iteration of the enclosing <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>do</code> loop to begin. In the <code>while</code> and <code>do</code>, this means that the test part is executed immediately; in the <code>for</code>, control passes to the increment step. The <code>continue</code> statement applies only to loops, not to <code>switch</code>. A <code>continue</code> inside a <code>switch</code> inside a loop causes the next loop iteration.</p>
<p>As an example, this fragment processes only the non-negative elements in the array a; negative values are skipped.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
    if (a[i] &lt; 0) /* skip negative elements */ 
        continue; 
    ... /* do positive elements */
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>continue</code> statement is often used when the part of the loop that follows is complicated, so that reversing a test and indenting another level would nest the program too deeply.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="goto-and-labels"><a class="header" href="#goto-and-labels">Goto and Labels</a></h1>
<p>C provides the infinitely-abusable <code>goto</code> statement, and labels to branch to. Formally, the <code>goto</code> statement is <em>never</em> necessary, and in practice it is almost always easy to write code without it. We have not used <code>goto</code> in this book.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are a few situations where gotos may find a place. The most common is to abandon processing in some deeply nested structure, such as breaking out of two or more loops at once. The break statement cannot be used directly since it only exits from the innermost loop. Thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">    for ( ... ) 
        for ( ... ) { 
                ... 
            if (disaster) 
                goto error; 
        } 
    ... 
error: 
    /* clean up the mess */
</code></pre>
<p>This organization is handy if the error-handling code is non-trivial, and if errors can occur in several places.</p>
<p>A label has the same form as a variable name, and is followed by a colon. It can be attached to any statement in the same function as the <code>goto</code>. The scope of a label is the entire function.</p>
<p>As another example, consider the problem of determining whether two arrays a and b have an element in common. One possibility is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
        for (j = 0; j &lt; m; j++) 
            if (a[i] == b[j]) 
                goto found; 
    /* didn't find any common element */ 
    ... 
found: 
    /* got one: a[i] == b[j] */ 
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Code involving a <code>goto</code> can <em>always</em> be written without one, though perhaps at the price of some repeated tests or an extra variable. For example, the array search becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">found = 0; 
for (i = 0; i &lt; n &amp;&amp; !found; i++) 
    for (j = 0; j &lt; m &amp;&amp; !found; j++) 
        if (a[i] == b[j]) 
            found = 1; 
if (found) 
    /* got one: a[i-1] == b[j-1] */ 
    ... 
else 
    /* didn't find any common element */ 
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>With a few exceptions like those cited here, code that relies on <code>goto</code> statements is generally harder to understand and to maintain than code without gotos. Although we are not dogmatic about the matter, it does seem that <code>goto</code> statements should be used rarely, if at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong></p>
<p>Never, <em>ever</em> use a <code>goto</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>goto</code>statement is a remnant of <strong>Assembly</strong>. In Assembly there is often a <code>jump</code> instruction, that allows you to <em>jump</em> to any part of your code.
Jumping around in your code like that is a necessity in Assembly, because it is so low level.</p>
<p>C provides structured control flow constructs like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>, which allow us to achieve the same logic as <code>goto</code> in a clearer, more maintainable way as discussed in Chapter 3. These can, as mentioned above, achieve the exact same goal as a <code>goto</code>can. So there is no reason to use it. Additionally, using goto can obscure control flow, making debugging and maintenance harder.</p>

<p>Functions break large computing tasks into smaller ones, and enable people to build on what others have done instead of starting over from scratch. Appropriate functions hide details of operation from parts of the program that don't need to know about them, thus clarifying the whole, and easing the pain of making changes.</p>
<p>C has been designed to make functions efficient and easy to use; C programs generally consist of many small functions rather than a few big ones. A program may reside in one or more source files. Source files may be compiled separately and loaded together, along with previously compiled functions from libraries. We will not go into that process here, however, since the details vary from system to system.</p>
<p>Function declaration and definition is the area where the ANSI standard has made the most changes to C. As we saw first in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a>, it is now possible to declare the type of arguments when a function is declared. The syntax of function declaration also changes, so that declarations and definitions match. This makes it possible for a compiler to detect many more errors than it could before. Furthermore, when arguments are properly declared, appropriate type coercions are performed automatically.</p>
<p>The standard clarifies the rules on the scope of names; in particular, it requires that there be only one definition of each external object. Initialization is more general: automatic arrays and structures may now be initialized.</p>
<p>The C preprocessor has also been enhanced. New preprocessor facilities include a more complete set of conditional compilation directives, a way to create quoted strings from macro arguments, and better control over the macro expansion process.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basics-of-functions"><a class="header" href="#basics-of-functions">Basics of Functions</a></h1>
<p>To begin with, let us design and write a program to print each line of its input that contains a particular "pattern" or string of characters. (This is a special case of the UNIX program <code>grep</code>.) For example, searching for the pattern of letters "ould" in the set of lines:</p>
<pre><code>Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire 
To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire, 
Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then 
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!
</code></pre>
<p>will produce the output:</p>
<pre><code>Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire 
Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then 
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!
</code></pre>
<p>The job falls neatly into three pieces:</p>
<pre><code>while (there's another line) 
    if (the line contains the pattern) 
        print it
</code></pre>
<p>Although it's certainly possible to put the code for all of this in <code>main</code>, a better way is to use the structure to our  advantage by making each part a separate function. Three small pieces are better to deal with than one big one, because irrelevant details can be buried in the functions, and the chance of unwanted interactions is minimized. And the pieces may even be useful in other programs.</p>
<p>"While there's another line" is <code>getline</code>, a function that we wrote in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a>, and "print it" is <code>printf</code>, which someone has already provided for us. This means we need only write a routine to decide whether the line contains an occurrence of the pattern.</p>
<p>We can solve that problem by writing a function <code>strindex(s,t)</code> that returns the position or index in the string <code>s</code> where the string <code>t</code> begins, or -1 if <code>s</code> does not contain <code>t</code>. Because C arrays begin at position zero, indexes will be zero or positive, and so a negative value like -1 is convenient for signaling failure. When we later need more sophisticated pattern matching, we only have to replace <code>strindex</code>; the rest of the code can remain the same. (The standard library provides a function <code>strstr</code> that is similar to <code>strindex</code>, except that it returns a pointer instead of an index.)</p>
<p>Given this much design, filling in the details of the program is straightforward. Here is the whole thing, so you can see how the pieces fit together. For now, the pattern to be searched for is a literal string, which is not the most general of mechanisms. We will return shortly to a discussion of how to initialize character arrays, and in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter5/5-0.html">Chapter 5</a> will show how to make the pattern a parameter that is set when the program is run. There is also a slightly different version of <code>getline</code>; you might find it instructive to compare it to the one in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    char line[MAXLINE];
    int found = 0;

    while (getline_local(line, MAXLINE) &gt; 0)
        if (strindex(line, pattern) &gt;= 0) {
            printf("%s", line);

            return i;
    }
    return -1;

</code></pre>
<p>Each function definition has the form</p>
<pre><code>return-type function-name(*argument declarations) { 
    
    *declarations and statements* 

}
</code></pre>
<p>Various parts may be absent; a minimal function is</p>
<pre><code>dummy() {}
</code></pre>
<p>which does nothing and returns nothing. A do-nothing function like this is sometimes useful as a placeholder during program development. If the return type is omitted, <code>int</code> is assumed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em></p>
<p>That last statement "If the return type is omitted, <code>int</code> is assumed." is only true for older versions of C. Starting from C99, the implicit return type is no longer present and will result in a compiler error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A program is just a set of definitions of variables and functions. Communication between the functions is by arguments and values returned by the functions, and through external variables. The functions can occur in any order in the source file, and the source program can be split into multiple files, so long as no function is split.</p>
<p>The <code>return</code> statement is the mechanism for returning a value from the called function to its caller. Any expression can follow <code>return</code>:</p>
<pre><code>return *expression*;
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>expression</em> will be converted to the return type of the function if necessary. Parentheses are often used around the <em>expression</em>, but they are optional.</p>
<p>The calling function is free to ignore the returned value. Furthermore, there need to be no expression after <code>return</code>; in that case, no value is returned to the caller. Control also returns to the caller with no value when execution "falls off the end" of the function by reaching the closing right brace. It is not illegal, but probably a sign of trouble, if a function returns a value from one place and no value from another. In any case, if a function fails to return a value, its "value" is certain to be garbage.</p>
<p>The pattern-searching program returns a status from <code>main</code>, the number of matches found. This value is available for use by the environment that called the program.</p>
<p>The mechanics of how to compile and load a C program that resides on multiple source files vary from one system to the next. On the UNIX system, for example, the <code>cc</code> command mentioned in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a> does the job. Suppose that the three functions are stored in three files called <code>main.c</code>, <code>getline.c</code>, and <code>strindex.c</code>. Then the command:</p>
<pre><code>cc main.c getline.c strindex.c
</code></pre>
<p>compiles the three files, placing the resulting object code in files <code>main.o</code>, <code>getline.o</code>, and <code>strindex.o</code>, then loads them all into an executable file called <code>a.out</code>. If there is an error, say in <code>main.c</code>, the file can be recompiled by itself and the result loaded with the previous object files, with the command:</p>
<pre><code>cc main.c getline.o strindex.o 
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>cc</code> command uses the ".c" versus ".o" naming convention to distinguish source files from object files.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter4/../Solutions/Chapter4/E4-1.html"><strong>Exercise 4-1.</strong></a> Write the function <code>strindex(s,t)</code> which returns the position of the <em>rightmost</em> occurrence of <code>t</code> in <code>s</code>, or -1 if there is none.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions-returning-non-integers"><a class="header" href="#functions-returning-non-integers">Functions Returning Non-Integers</a></h1>
<p>So far our examples of functions have returned either no value (<code>void</code>) or an <code>int</code>. What if a function must return some other type? Many numerical functions like <code>sqrt</code>, <code>sin</code>, and <code>cos</code> return <code>double</code>; other specialized functions return other types. To illustrate how to deal with this, let us write and use the function <code>atof(s)</code>, which converts the string s to its double precision floating-point equivalent. <code>atof</code> is an extension of <code>atoi</code>, which we showed versions of in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter2/2-0.html">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter3/3-0.html">Chapter 3</a>. It handles an optional sign and decimal point, and the presence or absence of either part or fractional part. Our version is <em>not</em> a high-quality input conversion routine; that would take more space than we care to use. The standard library includes an <code>atof</code>; the header &lt;stdlib.h&gt; declares it.</p>
<p>First, <code>atof</code> itself must declare the type of value it returns, since it is not <code>int</code>. The type name precedes the function name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;ctype.h&gt; 

/* atof: convert string s to double */ 
double atof(char s[]) {

    double val, power; 
    int i, sign; 
    
    for (i = 0; isspace(s[i]); i++) /* skip white space */ 
        ; 
    sign = (s[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1; 
    if (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-') 
        i++; 
    for (val = 0.0; isdigit(s[i]); i++) 
        val = 10.0 * val + (s[i] - '0'); 
    if (s[i] == '.') 
        i++; 
    for (power = 1.0; isdigit(s[i]); i++) { 
        val = 10.0 * val + (s[i] - '0'); 
        power *= 10; 
    } 
    return sign * val / power; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Second, and just as important, the calling routine must know that <code>atof</code> returns a non-int value. One way to ensure this is to declare <code>atof</code> explicitly in the calling routine. The declaration is shown in this primitive calculator (barely adequate for check-book balancing), which reads one number per line, optionally preceded with a sign, and adds them up, printing the running sum after each input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#define MAXLINE 100

/* rudimentary calculator */
main(){

    double sum, atof(char []);
    char line[MAXLINE];
    int getline(char line[], int max);

    sum = 0;
    while (getline(line, MAXLINE) &gt; 0)
        printf("\t%g\n", sum += atof(line));
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">double sum, atof(char []);
</code></pre>
<p>says that <code>sum</code> is a <code>double</code> variable, and that <code>atof</code> is a function that takes one <code>char[]</code> argument and returns a <code>double</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>atof</code> must be declared and defined consistently. If <code>atof</code> itself and the call to it in <code>main</code> have inconsistent types in the same source file, the error will be detected by the compiler. But if (as is more likely) <code>atof</code> were compiled separately, the mismatch would not be detected, <code>atof</code> would return a <code>double</code> that <code>main</code> would treat as an <code>int</code>, and meaningless answers would result.</p>
<p>In the light of what we have said about how declarations must match definitions, this might seem surprising. The reason a mismatch can happen is that if there is no function prototype, a function is implicitly declared by its first appearance in an expression, such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">sum += atof(line)
</code></pre>
<p>If a name that has not been previously declared occurs in an expression and is followed by a left parentheses, it is declared by context to be a function name, the function is assumed to return an <code>int</code>, and nothing is assumed about its arguments. Furthermore, if a function declaration does not include arguments, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">double atof();
</code></pre>
<p>that too is taken to mean that nothing is to be assumed about the arguments of <code>atof</code>; all parameter checking is turned off. This special meaning of the empty argument list is intended to permit older C programs to compile with new compilers. But it's a bad idea to use it with new C programs. If the function takes arguments, declare them; if it takes no arguments, use <code>void</code>.</p>
<p>Given <code>atof</code>, properly declared, we could write <code>atoi</code> (convert a string to <code>int</code>) in terms of it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* atoi: convert string s to integer using atof */ 
int atoi(char s[]) { 

    double atof(char s[]);
    return (int) atof(s);
} 
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the structure of the declarations and the return statement. The value of the expression in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">return expression;
</code></pre>
<p>is converted to the type of the function before the <code>return</code> is taken. Therefore, the value of <code>atof</code>, a <code>double</code>, is converted automatically to <code>int</code> when it appears in this return, since the function <code>atoi</code> returns an <code>int</code>. This operation does potentially discard information, however, so some compilers warn of it. The cast states explicitly that the operation is intended, and suppresses any warning.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter4/../Solutions/Chapter4/E4-2.html"><strong>Exercise 4-2.</strong></a> Extend <code>atof</code> to handle scientific notation of the form: "123.45e-6". Where a floating-point number may be followed by "e" or "E" and an optionally signed exponent.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="external-variables"><a class="header" href="#external-variables">External Variables</a></h1>
<p>A C program consists of a set of external objects, which are either variables or functions. The adjective "external" is used in contrast to "internal", which describes the arguments and variables defined inside functions. External variables are defined outside of any function, and are thus potentially available to many functions. Functions themselves are always external, because C does not allow functions to be defined inside other functions. By default, external variables and functions have the property that all references to them by the same name, even from functions compiled separately, are references to the same thing. (The standard calls this property <em>external linkage</em>.) In this sense, external variables are analogous to Fortran COMMON blocks or variables in the outermost block in Pascal. We will see later how to define external variables and functions that are visible only within a single source file. Because external variables are globally accessible, they provide an alternative to function arguments and return values for communicating data between functions. Any function may access an external variable by referring to it by name, if the name has been declared somehow.</p>
<p>If a large number of variables must be shared among functions, external variables are more convenient and efficient than long argument lists. As pointed out in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter1/1-0.html">Chapter 1</a>, however, this reasoning should be applied with some caution, for it can have a bad effect on program structure, and lead to programs with too many data connections between functions.</p>
<p>External variables are also useful because of their greater scope and lifetime. Automatic variables are internal to a function; they come into existence when the function is entered, and disappear when it is left. External variables, on the other hand, are permanent, so they can retain values from one function invocation to the next. Thus if two functions must share some data, yet neither calls the other, it is often most convenient if the shared data is kept in external variables rather than being passed in and out via arguments.</p>
<p>Let us examine this issue with a larger example. The problem is to write a calculator program that provides the operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>. Because it is easier to implement, the calculator will use reverse Polish notation instead of infix. (Reverse Polish notation is used by some pocket calculators, and in languages like Forth and Postscript.)</p>
<p>In reverse Polish notation, each operator follows its operands; an infix expression like:</p>
<pre><code>(1 - 2) * (4 + 5)
</code></pre>
<p>is entered as:</p>
<pre><code>1 2 - 4 5 + *
</code></pre>
<p>Parentheses are not needed; the notation is unambiguous as long as we know how many operands each operator expects.</p>
<p>The implementation is simple. Each operand is pushed onto a stack; when an operator arrives, the proper number of operands (two for binary operators) is popped, the operator is applied to them, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. In the example above, for instance, 1 and 2 are pushed, then replaced by their difference, -1. Next, 4 and 5 are pushed and then replaced by their sum, 9. The product of -1 and 9, which is -9, replaces them on the stack. The value on the top of the stack is popped and printed when the end of the input line is encountered.</p>
<p>The structure of the program is thus a loop that performs the proper operation on each operator and operand as it appears:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">while (next operator or operand is not end-of-file indicator) 
    if (number) 
        push it
    else if (operator) 
        pop operands
        do operation
        push result
    else if (newline) 
        pop and print top of stack
    else 
        error
</code></pre>
<p>The operation of pushing and popping a stack are trivial, but by the time error detection and recovery are added, they are long enough that it is better to put each in a separate function than to repeat the code throughout the whole program. And there should be a separate function for fetching the next input operator or operand.</p>
<p>The main design decision that has not yet been discussed is <em>where</em> the stack is, that is, which routines access it directly. One possibility is to keep it in <code>main</code>, and pass the stack and the current stack position to the routines that push and pop it. But <code>main</code> doesn't need to know about the variables that control the stack; it only does <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> operations. So we have decided to store the stack and its associated information in external variables accessible to the <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> functions but not to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Translating this outline into code is easy enough. If for now we think of the program as existing in one source file, it will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>#includes 
#defines 

function declarations for *main* 

main() { ... }

external variables for *push* and *pop*

void push( double f) { ... } 

double pop(void) { ... } 

int getop(char s[]) { ... } 
    routines called by getop
</code></pre>
<p>Later we will discuss how this might be split into two or more source files.</p>
<p>The function <code>main</code> is a loop containing a big switch on the type of operator or operand; this is a more typical use of switch than the one shown in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter3/3-4.html">Section 3.4</a>.</p>

<p>Because <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are commutative operators, the order in which the popped operands are combined is irrelevant, but for <code>-</code> and <code>/</code> the left and right operand must be distinguished. In:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">push(pop() - pop()); /* WRONG */ 
</code></pre>
<p>the order in which the two calls of pop are evaluated is not defined. To guarantee the right order, it is necessary to pop the first value into a temporary variable as we did in <code>main</code>.</p>

<p>A variable is external if it is defined outside of any function. Thus the stack and stack index that must be shared by <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> are defined outside these functions. But <code>main</code> itself does not refer to the stack or stack position - the representation can be hidden.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the implementation of <code>getop</code>, the function that fetches the next operator or operand. The task is easy. Skip blanks and tabs. If the next character is not a digit or a hexadecimal point, return it. Otherwise, collect a string of digits (which might include a decimal point), and return NUMBER, the signal that a number has been collected.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;ctype.h&gt; 

int getch(void); 
void ungetch(int); 

/* getop: get next character or numeric operand */ 
int getop(char s[]) { 

    int i, c; 

    while ((s[0] = c = getch()) == ' ' || c == '\t') 
        ; 

    s[1] = '\0'; 

    if (!isdigit(c) &amp;&amp; c != '.') 
        return c; /* not a number */ 

    i = 0; 

    if (isdigit(c)) /* collect integer part */ 
        while (isdigit(s[++i] = c = getch())) 
            ; 
    if (c == '.') /* collect fraction part */ 
        while (isdigit(s[++i] = c = getch())) 
            ; 

    s[i] = '\0'; 

    if (c != EOF) 
        ungetch(c); 
    return NUMBER; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>What are <code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code>? It is often the case that a program cannot determine that it has read enough input until it has read too much. One instance is collecting characters that make up a number: until the first non-digit is seen, the number is not complete. But then the program has read one character too far, a character that it is not prepared for.</p>
<p>The problem would be solved if it were possible to "un-read" the unwanted character. Then, every time the program reads one character too many, it could push it back on the input, so the rest of the code could behave as if it had never been read. Fortunately, it's easy to simulate un-getting a character, by writing a pair of cooperating functions. <code>getch</code> delivers the next input character to be considered; <code>ungetch</code> will return them before reading new input.</p>
<p>How they work together is simple. <code>ungetch</code> puts the pushed-back characters into a shared buffer -- a character array. <code>getch</code> reads from the buffer if there is anything else, and calls <code>getchar</code> if the buffer is empty. There must also be an index variable that records the position of the current character in the buffer.</p>
<p>Since the buffer and the index are shared by <code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code> and must retain their values between calls, they must be external to both routines. Thus we can write <code>getch</code>, <code>ungetch</code>, and their shared variables as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define BUFSIZE 100 
char buf[BUFSIZE]; /* buffer for ungetch */ 
int bufp = 0; /* next free position in buf */ 

int getch(void) {  /* get a (possibly pushed-back) character */ 

    return (bufp &gt; 0) ? buf[--bufp] : getchar(); 
} 

void ungetch(int c) {  /* push character back on input */ 

    if (bufp &gt;= BUFSIZE) 
        printf("ungetch: too many characters\n"); 
    else 
        buf[bufp++] = c; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The standard library includes a function <code>ungetch</code> that provides one character of pushback; we will discuss it in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter7/7-0.html">Chapter 7</a>. We have used an array for the pushback, rather than a single character, to illustrate a more general approach.</p>

<p>The functions and external variables that make up a C program need not all be compiled at the same time; the source text of the program may be kept in several files, and previously compiled routines may be loaded from libraries. Among the questions of interest are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are declarations written so that variables are properly declared during compilation?</li>
<li>How are declarations arranged so that all the pieces will be properly connected when the program is loaded?</li>
<li>How are declarations organized so there is only one copy?</li>
<li>How are external variables initialized?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us discuss these topics by reorganizing the calculator program into several files. As a practical matter, the calculator is too small to be worth splitting, but it is a fine illustration of the issues that arise in larger programs.</p>
<p>The <em>scope</em> of a name is the part of the program within which the name can be used. For an automatic variable declared at the beginning of a function, the scope is the function in which the name is declared. Local variables of the same name in different functions are unrelated. The same is true of the parameters of the function, which are in effect local variables.</p>
<p>The scope of an external variable or a function lasts from the point at which it is declared to the end of the file being compiled. For example, if <code>main</code>, <code>sp</code>, <code>val</code>, <code>push</code>, and <code>pop</code> are defined in one file, in the order shown above, that is;</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">main() { ... } 
int sp = 0; 
double val[MAXVAL]; 
void push(double f) { ... } 
double pop(void) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>then the variables <code>sp</code> and <code>val</code> may be used in <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> simply by naming them; no further declarations are needed. But these names are not visible in <code>main</code>, nor are <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> themselves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if an external variable is to be referred to before it is defined, or if it is defined in a different source file from the one where it is being used, then an <code>extern</code> declaration is mandatory.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the <em>declaration</em> of an external variable and its <em>definition</em>. A declaration announces the properties of a variable (primarily its type); a definition also causes storage to be set aside. If the lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int sp; 
double val[MAXVAL];
</code></pre>
<p>appear outside of any function, they <em>define</em> the external variables sp and val, cause storage to be set aside, and also serve as the declarations for the rest of that source file. On the other hand, the lines</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">extern int sp; 
extern double val[];
</code></pre>
<p><em>declare</em> for the rest of the source file that <code>sp</code> is an <code>int</code> and that <code>val</code> is a <code>double</code> array (whose size is determined elsewhere), but they do <em>not</em> create the variables or reserve storage for them.</p>
<p>There must be only one <em>definition</em> of an external variable among all the files that make up the source program; other files may contain <code>extern</code> declarations to access it. (There may also be <code>extern</code> declarations in the file containing the definition.) Array sizes must be specified with the definition, but are optional with an <code>extern</code> declaration.</p>
<p>Initialization of an external variable goes only with the definition.</p>
<p>Although it is not a likely organization for this program, the functions <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> could be defined in one file, and the variables <code>val</code> and <code>sp</code> defined and initialized in another. Then these definitions and declarations would be necessary to tie them together:</p>
<p><em>In file1</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">extern int sp; 
extern double val[]; 
void push(double f) { ... } 
double pop(void) { ... } 
</code></pre>
<p><em>In file2</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int sp = 0; double val[MAXVAL];
</code></pre>
<p>Because the <code>extern</code> declarations in <em>file1</em> lie ahead of and outside the function definitions, they apply to all functions; one set of declarations suffices for all of <em>file1</em>. This same organization would also be needed if the definition of <code>sp</code> and <code>val</code> followed their use in one file.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="header-files"><a class="header" href="#header-files">Header Files</a></h1>
<p>Let us now consider dividing the calculator program into several source files, as it might be if each of the components were substantially bigger. The <code>main</code> function would go in one file, which we will call <code>main.c</code>; <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, and their variables go into a second file, <code>stack.c</code>; <code>getop</code> goes into a third, <code>getop.c</code>. Finally, <code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code> go into a fourth file, <code>getch.c</code>; we separate them from the others because they would come from a separately-compiled library in a realistic program.</p>
<p>There is one more thing to worry about - the definitions and declarations shared among files. As much as possible, we want to centralize this, so that there is only one copy to get and keep right as the program evolves. Accordingly, we will place this common material in a <em>header file</em>, <code>calc.h</code>, which will be included as necessary. (The <code>#include</code> line is described in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter4/4-11.html">Section 4.11.</a>) The resulting program then looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="Chapter4/../Images/4-5%20-%20Header%20Files.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There is a tradeoff between the desire that each file have access only to the information it needs for its job and the practical reality that it is harder to maintain more header files. Up to some moderate program size, it is probably best to have one header file that contains everything that is to be shared between any two parts of the program; that is the decision we made here. For a much larger program, more organization and more headers would be needed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="static-variables"><a class="header" href="#static-variables">Static Variables</a></h1>
<p>The variables <code>sp</code> and <code>val</code> in <code>stack.c</code>, and <code>buf</code> and <code>bufp</code> in <code>getch.c</code>, are for the private use of the functions in their respective source files, and are not meant to be accessed by anything else. The <code>static</code> declaration, applied to an external variable or function, limits the scope of that object to the rest of the source file being compiled. External <code>static</code> thus provides a way to hide names like <code>buf</code> and <code>bufp</code> in the <code>getch-ungetch</code> combination, which must be external so they can be shared, yet which should not be visible to users of <code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code>.</p>
<p>Static storage is specified by prefixing the normal declaration with the word <code>static</code>. If the two routines and the two variables are compiled in one file, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static char buf[BUFSIZE]; /* buffer for ungetch */ 
static int bufp = 0; /* next free position in buf */ 

int getch(void) { ... } 
void ungetch(int c) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>then no other routine will be able to access <code>buf</code> and <code>bufp</code>, and those names will not conflict with the same names in other files of the same program. In the same way, the variables that <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> use for stack manipulation can be hidden, by declaring <code>sp</code> and <code>val</code> to be static.</p>
<p>The external <code>static</code> declaration is most often used for variables, but it can be applied to functions as well. Normally, function names are global, visible to any part of the entire program. If a function is declared <code>static</code>, however, its name is invisible outside of the file in which it is declared.</p>
<p>The <code>static</code> declaration can also be applied to internal variables. Internal <code>static</code> variables are local to a particular function just as automatic variables are, but unlike automatics, they remain in existence rather than coming and going each time the function is activated. This means that internal static variables provide private, permanent storage within a single function.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter4/../Solutions/Chapter4/E4-11.html"><strong>Exercise 4-11.</strong></a> Modify <code>getop</code> so that it doesn't need to use <code>ungetch</code>. Hint: use an internal <code>static</code> variable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em></p>
<p>To clear up some details, <code>extern</code> means the variable (or function) is accessible by anyone, in any file.</p>
<p><code>Static</code>, however, can be used in 2 ways.<br />
The first is as an "external" <code>static</code>, that means the entire source file can use it, but no one outside of it.<br />
The second is as an "internal" <code>static</code>, where it's tied to a specific function, and can't be used by anyone else even in the same source file.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="register-variables"><a class="header" href="#register-variables">Register Variables</a></h1>
<p>A <code>register</code> declaration advises the compiler that the variable in question will be heavily used. The idea is that register variables are to be placed in machine registers, which may result in smaller and faster programs. But compilers are free to ignore the advice.</p>
<p>The register declaration looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">register int x; register char c; 
</code></pre>
<p>and so on. The <code>register</code> declaration can only be applied to automatic variables and to the formal parameters of a function. In this later case, it looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">f(register unsigned m, register long n) { 

    register int i; 
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In practice, there are restrictions on <code>register</code> variables, reflecting the realities of underlying hardware. Only a few variables in each function may be kept in registers, and only certain types are allowed. Excess <code>register</code> declarations are harmless, however, since the word <code>register</code> is ignored for excess or disallowed declarations. And it is not possible to take the address of a register variable (a topic covered in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter5/5-0.html">Chapter 5</a>), regardless of whether the variable is actually placed in a register. The specific restrictions on number and types of register variables vary from machine to machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em></p>
<p>You <em>really</em> don't need this, unless you're planning on programming embedded systems.<br />
The compiler is optimized to such an extent that i will plainly ignore all the <code>register</code> declarations, since 9 times out of 10 it can find a more efficient approach.</p>
<p>You will probably never see or use this keyword in any C code.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="block-structure"><a class="header" href="#block-structure">Block Structure</a></h1>
<p>C is not a block-structured language in the sense of Pascal or similar languages, because functions may not be defined within other functions. On the other hand, variables can be defined in a block-structured fashion within a function. Declarations of variables (including initializations) may follow the left brace that introduces <em>any</em> compound statement, not just the one that begins a function. Variables declared in this way hide any identically named variables in outer blocks, and remain in existence until the matching right brace. For example, in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (n &gt; 0) { 

    int i; /* declare a new i */ 
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
        ... 
}
</code></pre>
<p>the scope of the variable <code>i</code> is the "true" branch of the <code>if</code>; this <code>i</code> is unrelated to any <code>i</code> outside the block. An automatic variable declared and initialized in a block is initialized each time the block is entered.</p>
<p>Automatic variables, including formal parameters, also hide external variables and functions of the same name. Given the declarations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int x; 
int y; 
f(double x) { 

    double y; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>then within the function <code>f</code>, occurrences of <code>x</code> refer to the parameter, which is a double; outside <code>f</code>, they refer to the external <code>int</code>. The same is true of the variable <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>As a matter of style, it's best to avoid variable names that conceal names in an outer scope; the potential for confusion and error is too great.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="initialization"><a class="header" href="#initialization">Initialization</a></h1>
<p>Initialization has been mentioned in passing many times so far, but always peripherally to some other topic. This section summarizes some of the rules, now that we have discussed the various storage classes.</p>
<p>In the absence of explicit initialization, external and static variables are guaranteed to be initialized to zero; automatic and register variables have undefined (i.e., garbage) initial values.</p>
<p>Scalar variables may be initialized when they are defined, by following the name with an equals sign and an expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int x = 1; 
char squota = '\''; 
long day = 1000L * 60L * 60L * 24L; /* milliseconds/day */
</code></pre>
<p>For external and static variables, the initializer must be a constant expression; the initialization is done once, conceptually before the program begins execution. For automatic and register variables, the initializer is not restricted to being a constant: it may be any expression involving previously defined values, even function calls. For example, the initialization of the binary search program in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter3/3-3.html">Section 3.3</a> could be written as</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n) { 

    int low = 0; 
    int high = n - 1; 
    int mid; 
    ... 
} 
</code></pre>
<p>instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int low, high, mid; 
low = 0; 
high = n - 1;
</code></pre>
<p>In effect, initialization of automatic variables are just shorthand for assignment statements. Which form to prefer is largely a matter of taste. We have generally used explicit assignments, because initializers in declarations are harder to see and further away from the point of use.</p>
<p>An array may be initialized by following its declaration with a list of initializers enclosed in braces and separated by commas. For example, to initialize an array <code>days</code> with the number of days in each month:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int days[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };
</code></pre>
<p>When the size of the array is omitted, the compiler will compute the length by counting the initializers, of which there are 12 in this case.</p>
<p>If there are fewer initializers for an array than the specified size, the others will be zero for external, static and automatic variables. It is an error to have too many initializers. There is no way to specify repetition of an initializer, nor to initialize an element in the middle of an array without supplying all the preceding values as well.</p>
<p>Character arrays are a special case of initialization; a string may be used instead of the braces and commas notation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char pattern[] = "ould"; 
</code></pre>
<p>is a shorthand for the longer but equivalent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char pattern[] = { 'o', 'u', 'l', 'd', '\0' }; 
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the array size is five (four characters plus the terminating '\0').</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em></p>
<p>When using a string literal like "ould", an important side effect is that it will always be stored in static memory and last for the entire duration of the program.</p>
<p>On the contrary, using the second approach, it exists solely on the stack for the duration of the scope it was declared in.</p>
<p>In both cases, the actual array exists on the stack, but the memory for the string literal is <em>still</em> statically allocated.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="recursion"><a class="header" href="#recursion">Recursion</a></h1>
<p>C functions may be used recursively; that is, a function may call itself either directly or indirectly. Consider printing a number as a character string. As we mentioned before, the digits are generated in the wrong order: low-order digits are available before high-order digits, but they have to be printed the other way around.</p>
<p>There are two solutions to this problem. One is to store the digits in an array as they are generated, then print them in the reverse order, as we did with <code>itoa</code> in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter3/3-6.html">section 3.6</a>. The alternative is a recursive solution, in which <code>printd</code> first calls itself to cope with any leading digits, then prints the trailing digit. Again, this version can fail on the largest negative number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
    /* printd: print n in decimal */ 
    void printd(int n) { 

        if (n &lt; 0) { 
            putchar('-'); 
            n = -n; 
        } 
        if (n / 10) 
            printd(n / 10); 
        putchar(n % 10 + '0'); 
    }
</code></pre>
<p>When a function calls itself recursively, each invocation gets a fresh set of all the automatic variables, independent of the previous set. In <code>printd(123)</code> the first <code>printd</code> receives the argument n = 123. It passes 12 to a second <code>printd</code>, which in turn passes 1 to a third. The third-level <code>printd</code> prints 1, then returns to the second level. That <code>printd</code> prints 2, then returns to the first level. That one prints 3 and terminates.</p>
<p>Another good example of recursion is quicksort, a sorting algorithm developed by <em>C.A.R. Hoare</em> in 1962. Given an array, one element is chosen and the others partitioned in two subsets - those less than the partition element and those greater than or equal to it. The same process is then applied recursively to the two subsets. When a subset has fewer than two elements, it doesn't need any sorting; this stops the recursion.</p>
<p>Our version of quicksort is not the fastest possible, but it's one of the simplest. We use the middle element of each subarray for partitioning.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">    /* qsort: sort v[left]...v[right] into increasing order */ 
    void qsort(int v[], int left, int right) { 

        int i, last; 
        void swap(int v[], int i, int j);

        if (left &gt;= right) /* do nothing if array contains */ 
            return; /* fewer than two elements */ 
        swap(v, left, (left + right)/2); /* move partition elem */ 
        last = left; /* to v[0] */ 
        for (i = left + 1; i &lt;= right; i++) /* partition */ 
            if (v[i] &lt; v[left]) 
                swap(v, ++last, i); 
        swap(v, left, last); /* restore partition elem */ 
        qsort(v, left, last-1); 
        qsort(v, last+1, right);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>We moved the swapping operation into a separate function <code>swap</code> because it occurs three times in <code>qsort</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">    /* swap: interchange v[i] and v[j] */ 
    void swap(int v[], int i, int j) { 
        int temp; 
        temp = v[i]; 
        v[i] = v[j]; 
        v[j] = temp; 
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The standard library includes a version of <code>qsort</code> that can sort objects of any type.</p>
<p>Recursion may provide no saving in storage, since somewhere a stack of the values being processed must be maintained. Nor will it be faster. But recursive code is more compact, and often much easier to write and understand than the non-recursive equivalent. Recursion is especially convenient for recursively defined data structures like trees, we will see a nice example in <a href="Chapter4/../Chapter6/6-0.html">Section 6.6</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter4/../Solutions/Chapter4/E4-12.html"><strong>Exercise 4-12.</strong></a> Adapt the ideas of <code>printd</code> to write a recursive version of <code>itoa</code>; that is, convert an integer into a string by calling a recursive routine.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-c-preprocessor"><a class="header" href="#the-c-preprocessor">The C Preprocessor</a></h1>
<p>C provides certain language facilities by means of a preprocessor, which is conceptually a separate first step in compilation. The two most frequently used features are <code>#include</code>, to include the contents of a file during compilation, and <code>#define</code>, to replace a token by an arbitrary sequence of characters. Other features described in this section include conditional compilation and macros with arguments.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="file-inclusion"><a class="header" href="#file-inclusion">File Inclusion</a></h1>
<p>File inclusion makes it easy to handle collections of #defines and declarations (among other things). Any source line of the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include "filename"
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>is replaced by the contents of the file <em>filename</em>. If the <em>filename</em> is quoted, searching for the file typically begins where the source program was found; if it is not found there, or if the name is enclosed in <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>, searching follows an implementation-defined rule to find the file. An included file may itself contain <code>#include</code> lines.</p>
<p>There are often several <code>#include</code> lines at the beginning of a source file, to include common <code>#define</code> statements and extern declarations, or to access the function prototype declarations for library functions from headers like <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>. (Strictly speaking, these need not be files; the details of how headers are accessed are implementation-dependent.)</p>
<p><code>#include</code> is the preferred way to tie the declarations together for a large program. It guarantees that all the source files will be supplied with the same definitions and variable declarations, and thus eliminates a particularly nasty kind of bug. Naturally, when an included file is changed, all files that depend on it must be recompiled.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="macro-substitution"><a class="header" href="#macro-substitution">Macro Substitution</a></h1>
<p>A definition has the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define name replacement text 
</code></pre>
<p>It calls for a macro substitution of the simplest kind - subsequent occurrences of the token name will be replaced by the <em>replacement text</em>. The name in a <code>#define</code> has the same form as a variable name; the replacement text is arbitrary. Normally the replacement text is the rest of the line, but a long definition may be continued onto several lines by placing a <code>\</code> at the end of each line to be continued. The scope of a name defined with <code>#define</code> is from its point of definition to the end of the source file being compiled. A definition may use previous definitions. Substitutions are made only for tokens, and do not take place within quoted strings. For example, if <code>YES</code> is a defined name, there would be no substitution in <code>printf("YES")</code> or in <code>YESMAN</code>.</p>
<p>Any name may be defined with any replacement text. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define forever for (;;) /* infinite loop */ 
</code></pre>
<p>defines a new word, <code>forever</code>, for an infinite loop.</p>
<p>It is also possible to define macros with arguments, so the replacement text can be different for different calls of the macro. As an example, define a macro called <code>max</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define max(A, B) ((A) &gt; (B) ? (A) : (B)) 
</code></pre>
<p>Although it looks like a function call, a use of <code>max</code> expands into in-line code. Each occurrence of a formal parameter (here A or B) will be replaced by the corresponding actual argument. Thus the line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x = max(p+q, r+s); 
</code></pre>
<p>will be replaced by the line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x = ((p+q) &gt; (r+s) ? (p+q) : (r+s)); 
</code></pre>
<p>So long as the arguments are treated consistently, this macro will serve for any data type; there is no need for different kinds of max for different data types, as there would be with functions.</p>
<p>If you examine the expansion of <code>max</code>, you will notice some pitfalls. The expressions are evaluated twice; this is bad if they involve side effects like increment operators or input and output. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">max(i++, j++) /* WRONG */ 
</code></pre>
<p>will increment the larger twice. Some care also has to be taken with parentheses to make sure the order of evaluation is preserved; consider what happens when the macro:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define square(x) x * x /* WRONG */ 
</code></pre>
<p>is invoked as <code>square(z+1)</code>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, macros are valuable. One practical example comes from <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, in which <code>getchar</code> and <code>putchar</code> are often defined as macros to avoid the run-time overhead of a function call per character processed. The functions in <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code> are also usually implemented as macros.</p>
<p>Names may be undefined with <code>#undef</code>, usually to ensure that a routine is really a function, not a macro:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#undef getchar

int getchar(void) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Formal parameters are not replaced within quoted strings. If, however, a parameter name is preceded by a <code>#</code> in the replacement text, the combination will be expanded into a quoted string with the parameter replaced by the actual argument. This can be combined with string concatenation to make, for example, a debugging print macro:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define dprint(expr) printf(#expr " = %g\n", expr) 
</code></pre>
<p>When this is invoked, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">dprint(x/y) 
</code></pre>
<p>the macro is expanded into:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("x/y" " = %g\n", x/y); 
</code></pre>
<p>and the strings are concatenated, so the effect is</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("x/y = %g\n", x/y);
</code></pre>
<p>Within the actual argument, each <code>"</code> is replaced by <code>\"</code> and each <code>\</code> by <code>\\</code>, so the result is a legal string constant.</p>
<p>The preprocessor operator <code>##</code> provides a way to concatenate actual arguments during macro expansion. If a parameter in the replacement text is adjacent to a <code>##</code>, the parameter is replaced by the actual argument, the <code>##</code> and surrounding white space are removed, and the result is re-scanned. For example, the macro <code>paste</code> concatenates its two arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define paste(front, back) front ## back 
</code></pre>
<p>so :</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">paste(name, 1) 
</code></pre>
<p>creates the token <code>name1</code>.</p>
<p>The rules for nested uses of <code>##</code> are arcane; further details may be found in <a href="Chapter4/../AppendixA/A1.html">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter4/../Solutions/Chapter4/E4-14.html"><strong>Exercise 4-14.</strong></a> Define a macro <code>swap(t,x,y)</code> that interchanges two arguments of type <code>t</code>. (Block structure will help.)</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="conditional-inclusion"><a class="header" href="#conditional-inclusion">Conditional Inclusion</a></h1>
<p>It is possible to control preprocessing itself with conditional statements that are evaluated during preprocessing. This provides a way to include code selectively, depending on the value of conditions evaluated during compilation.</p>
<p>The <code>#if</code> line evaluates a constant integer expression (which may not include <code>sizeof</code>, casts, or <code>enum</code> constants). If the expression is non-zero, subsequent lines until an <code>#endif</code> or <code>#elif</code> or <code>#else</code> are included. (The preprocessor statement <code>#elif</code> is like <code>else-if</code>.) The expression <code>defined(*name*)</code> in a <code>#if</code> is 1 if the <em>name</em> has been defined, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, to make sure that the contents of a file <code>hdr.h</code> are included only once, the contents of the file are surrounded with a conditional like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#if !defined(HDR) 
#define HDR 

/* contents of hdr.h go here */ 

#endif
</code></pre>
<p>The first inclusion of <code>hdr.h</code> defines the name <code>HDR</code>; subsequent inclusions will find the name defined and skip down to the <code>#endif</code>. A similar style can be used to avoid including files multiple times. If this style is used consistently, then each header can itself include any other headers on which it depends, without the user of the header having to deal with the interdependence.</p>
<p>This sequence tests the name <code>SYSTEM</code> to decide which version of a header to include:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#if SYSTEM == SYSV 
    #define HDR "sysv.h" 
#elif SYSTEM == BSD 
    #define HDR "bsd.h" 
#elif SYSTEM == MSDOS 
    #define HDR "msdos.h" 
#else 
    #define HDR "default.h" 
#endif 
#include HDR
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>#ifdef</code> and <code>#ifndef</code> lines are specialized forms that test whether a name is defined. The first example of <code>#if</code> above could have been written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#ifndef HDR 
#define HDR 

/* contents of hdr.h go here */ 

#endif
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-5---pointers-and-arrays"><a class="header" href="#chapter-5---pointers-and-arrays">Chapter 5 - Pointers and Arrays</a></h1>
<p>A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable. Pointers are much used in C, partly because they are sometimes the only way to express a computation, and partly because they usually lead to more compact and efficient code than can be obtained in other ways. Pointers and arrays are closely related; this chapter also explores this relationship and shows how to exploit it.</p>
<p>Pointers have been lumped with the <code>goto</code> statement as a marvelous way to create impossible-to-understand programs. This is certainly true when they are used carelessly, and it is easy to create pointers that point somewhere unexpected. With discipline, however, pointers can also be used to achieve clarity and simplicity. This is the aspect that we will try to illustrate.</p>
<p>The main change in ANSI C is to make explicit the rules about how pointers can be manipulated, in effect mandating what good programmers already practice and good compilers already enforce. In addition, the type <code>void *</code> (pointer to void) replaces <code>char *</code> as the proper type for a generic pointer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pointers-and-addresses"><a class="header" href="#pointers-and-addresses">Pointers and Addresses</a></h1>
<p>Let us begin with a simplified picture of how memory is organized. A typical machine has an array of consecutively numbered or addressed memory cells that may be manipulated individually or in contiguous groups. One common situation is that any byte can be a <code>char</code>, a pair of one-byte cells can be treated as a <code>short integer</code>, and four adjacent bytes form a <code>long</code>. A pointer is a group of cells (often two or four) that can hold an address. So if c is a <code>char</code> and p is a pointer that points to it, we could represent the situation this way:</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-1%20-%20Pointers%20And%20Addresses.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The unary operator <code>&amp;</code> gives the address of an object, so the statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">p = &amp;c;
</code></pre>
<p>assigns the address of c to the variable p, and p is said to "point to" c. The <code>&amp;</code> operator only applies to objects in memory: variables and array elements (and functions). It cannot be applied to expressions, constants, or register variables.</p>
<p>The unary operator <code>*</code> is the <em>indirection</em> or <em>dereferencing</em> operator; when applied to a pointer, it accesses the object the pointer points to. Suppose that x and y are integers and ip is a <code>pointer</code> to <code>int</code>. This artificial sequence shows how to declare a pointer and how to use <code>&amp;</code> and <code>*</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int x = 1, y = 2, z[10]; int *ip; /* ip is a pointer to int */
ip = &amp;x; /* ip now points to x */
y = *ip; /* y is now 1 */
*ip = 0; /* x is now 0 */
ip = &amp;z[0]; /* ip now points to z[0] */
</code></pre>
<p>The declaration of x, y, and z are what we've seen all along. The declaration of the <code>pointer</code> ip,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int *ip;
</code></pre>
<p>is intended as a mnemonic; it says that the expression <code>*ip</code> is an <code>int</code>. The syntax of the declaration for a variable mimics the syntax of expressions in which the variable might appear. This reasoning applies to function declarations as well. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">double *dp, atof(char *);
</code></pre>
<p>says that in an expression <code>*dp</code> and <code>atof(s)</code> have values of <code>double</code>, and that the argument of
<code>atof</code> is a <code>pointer</code> to <code>char</code>.</p>
<p>You should also note the implication that a pointer is constrained to point to a particular kind of object: every pointer points to a specific data type. (There is one exception: a "pointer to void" is used to hold any type of pointer but cannot be dereferenced itself. We'll come back to it in <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter5/5-11.html">Section 5.11</a>.)</p>
<p>If <code>ip</code> points to the integer x, then <code>*ip</code> can occur in any context where x could, so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*ip = *ip + 10;
</code></pre>
<p>increments *ip by 10.</p>
<p>The unary operators <code>*</code> and <code>&amp;</code> bind more tightly than arithmetic operators, so the assignment</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">y = *ip + 1;
</code></pre>
<p>takes whatever <code>ip</code> points at, adds 1, and assigns the result to y, while:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*ip += 1
</code></pre>
<p>increments what <code>ip</code> points to, as do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">++*ip
</code></pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">(*ip)++
</code></pre>
<p>The parentheses are necessary in this last example; without them, the expression would increment ip instead of what it points to, because unary operators like <code>*</code> and <code>++</code> associate right to left.</p>
<p>Finally, since pointers are variables, they can be used without dereferencing. For example, if <code>iq</code> is another pointer to <code>int</code>,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">iq = ip
</code></pre>
<p>copies the contents of ip into iq, thus making iq point to whatever ip pointed to.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pointers-and-function-arguments"><a class="header" href="#pointers-and-function-arguments">Pointers and Function Arguments</a></h1>
<p>Since C passes arguments to functions by value, there is no direct way for the called function to alter a variable in the calling function. For instance, a sorting routine might exchange two out-of-order arguments with a function called <code>swap</code>. It is not enough to write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">swap(a, b); 
</code></pre>
<p>where the swap function is defined as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void swap(int x, int y) {  /* WRONG */

    int temp; 
    temp = x; 
    x = y; 
    y = temp; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because of call by value, <code>swap</code> can't affect the arguments a and b in the routine that called it. The function above swaps <em>copies</em> of a and b.</p>
<p>The way to obtain the desired effect is for the calling program to pass <em>pointers</em> to the values to be changed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">swap(&amp;a, &amp;b);
</code></pre>
<p>Since the operator <code>&amp;</code> produces the address of a variable, <code>&amp;a</code> is a pointer to a. In <code>swap</code> itself, the parameters are declared as pointers, and the operands are accessed indirectly through them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void swap(int *px, int *py) { /* interchange *px and *py */

    int temp; 
    temp = *px; 
    *px = *py; 
    *py = temp; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Pictorially:</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-2%20-%20Pointers%20and%20Function%20Arguments.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Pointer arguments enable a function to access and change objects in the function that called it. As an example, consider a function <code>getint</code> that performs free-format input conversion by breaking a stream of characters into integer values, one integer per call. <code>getint</code> has to return the value it found and also signal end of file when there is no more input. These values have to be passed back by separate paths, for no matter what value is used for EOF, that could also be the value of an input integer.</p>
<p>One solution is to have <code>getint</code> return the end of file status as its function value, while using a pointer argument to store the converted integer back in the calling function. This is the scheme used by <code>scanf</code> as well; see <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter7/7-4.html">Section 7.4</a>.</p>
<p>The following loop fills an array with integers by calls to <code>getint</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int n, array[SIZE], getint(int *); 

for (n = 0; n &lt; SIZE &amp;&amp; getint(&amp;array[n]) != EOF; n++) 
    ;
</code></pre>
<p>Each call sets array[n] to the next integer found in the input and increments n. Notice that it is essential to pass the address of array[n] to <code>getint</code>. Otherwise there is no way for <code>getint</code> to communicate the converted integer back to the caller.</p>
<p>Our version of <code>getint</code> returns EOF for end of file, zero if the next input is not a number, and a positive value if the input contains a valid number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int getch(void); 
void ungetch(int); 

/* getint: get next integer from input into *pn */ 
int getint(int *pn) {

    int c, sign;
    while (isspace(c = getch())) /* skip white space */ 
        ; 
    if (!isdigit(c) &amp;&amp; c != EOF &amp;&amp; c != '+' &amp;&amp; c != '-') {
        ungetch(c); /* it is not a number */
        return 0;
    } 

    sign = (c == '-') ? -1 : 1;
    if (c == '+' || c == '-')
        c = getch();

    for (*pn = 0; isdigit(c); c = getch())
        *pn = 10 * *pn + (c - '0');

    *pn *= sign;
    if (c != EOF)
        ungetch(c);
    return c; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Throughout <code>getint</code>, <code>*pn</code> is used as an ordinary <code>int</code> variable. We have also used <code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code> (described in <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter4/4-3.html">Section 4.3</a>) so the one extra character that must be read can be pushed back onto the input.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter5/../Solutions/Chapter5/E5-1.html"><strong>Exercise 5-1.</strong></a> As written, <code>getint</code> treats a <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> not followed by a digit as a valid representation of zero. Fix it to push such a character back on the input.</p>

<p>In C, there is a strong relationship between pointers and arrays, strong enough that pointers and arrays should be discussed simultaneously. Any operation that can be achieved by array subscripting can also be done with pointers. The pointer version will in general be faster but, at least to the uninitiated, somewhat harder to understand.</p>
<p>The declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int a[10];
</code></pre>
<p>defines an array of size 10, that is, a block of 10 consecutive objects named <code>a[0]</code>, <code>a[1]</code>, ...,<code>a[9]</code>.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-3%20Pointers%20and%20Arrays%2001.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The notation <code>a[i]</code> refers to the i-th element of the array. If <code>pa</code> is a pointer to an integer, declared as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int *pa;
</code></pre>
<p>then the assignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">pa = &amp;a[0];
</code></pre>
<p>sets <code>pa</code> to point to element zero of <code>a</code>; that is, <code>pa</code> contains the address of <code>a[0]</code>.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-3%20Pointers%20and%20Arrays%2002.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now the assignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x = *pa;
</code></pre>
<p>will copy the contents of <code>a[0]</code> into <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>pa</code> points to a particular element of an array, then by definition <code>pa+1</code> points to the next element, <code>pa+i</code> points <code>i</code> elements after <code>pa</code>, and <code>pa-i</code> points <code>i</code> elements before. Thus, if <code>pa</code> points to <code>a[0]</code>,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*(pa+1)
</code></pre>
<p>refers to the contents of <code>a[1]</code>, <code>pa+i</code> is the address of <code>a[i]</code>, and <code>*(pa+i)</code> is the contents of <code>a[i]</code>.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-3%20Pointers%20and%20Arrays%2003.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>These remarks are true regardless of the type or size of the variables in the array <code>a</code>. The meaning of "adding 1 to a pointer", and by extension, all pointer arithmetic, is that <code>pa+1</code> points to the next object, and <code>pa+i</code> points to the i-th object beyond <code>pa</code>.</p>
<p>The correspondence between indexing and pointer arithmetic is very close. By definition, the value of a variable or expression of type <code>array</code> is the address of element zero of the array. Thus after the assignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">pa = &amp;a[0];
</code></pre>
<p><code>pa</code> and <code>a</code> have identical values. Since the name of an array is a synonym for the location of the initial element, the assignment <code>pa=&amp;a[0]</code> can also be written as</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">pa = a;
</code></pre>
<p>Rather more surprising, at first sight, is the fact that a reference to <code>a[i]</code> can also be written as <code>*(a+i)</code>. In evaluating <code>a[i]</code>, C converts it to <code>*(a+i)</code> immediately; the two forms are equivalent. Applying the operator <code>&amp;</code> to both parts of this equivalence, it follows that <code>&amp;a[i]</code> and <code>a+i</code> are also identical: <code>a+i</code> is the address of the i-th element beyond <code>a</code>. As the other side of this coin, if <code>pa</code> is a pointer, expressions might use it with a subscript; <code>pa[i]</code> is identical to <code>*(pa+i)</code>. In short, an array-and-index expression is equivalent to one written as a pointer and offset.</p>
<p>There is one difference between an array name and a pointer that must be kept in mind. A pointer is a variable, so <code>pa=a</code> and <code>pa++</code> are legal. But an array name is <em>not</em> a variable; constructions like <code>a=pa</code> and <code>a++</code> are illegal.</p>
<p>When an array name is passed to a function, what is passed is the location of the initial element. Within the called function, this argument is a local variable, and so an array name parameter is a pointer, that is, a variable containing an address. We can use this fact to write another version of <code>strlen</code>, which computes the length of a string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strlen: return length of string s */
int strlen(char *s)
{
    int n;
    for (n = 0; *s != '\0'; s++)
        n++;
    return n;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>s</code> is a pointer, incrementing it is perfectly legal; <code>s++</code> has no effect on the character string in the function that called <code>strlen</code>, but merely increments strlen's private copy of the pointer. That means that calls like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">strlen("hello, world"); /* string constant */
strlen(array); /* char array[100]; */
strlen(ptr); /* char *ptr; */
</code></pre>
<p>all work.</p>
<p>As formal parameters in a function definition,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char s[];
</code></pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *s;
</code></pre>
<p>are equivalent; we prefer the latter because it says more explicitly that the variable is a pointer. When an array name is passed to a function, the function can at its convenience believe that it has been handed either an array or a pointer, and manipulate it accordingly. It can even use both notations if it seems appropriate and clear.</p>
<p>It is possible to pass part of an array to a function, by passing a pointer to the beginning of the sub-array. For example, if <code>a</code> is an array,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">f(&amp;a[2])
</code></pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">f(a+2)
</code></pre>
<p>both pass to the function <code>f</code> the address of the sub-array that starts at <code>a[2]</code>. Within <code>f</code>, the parameter declaration can read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">f(int arr[]) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">f(int *arr) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>So as far as <code>f</code> is concerned, the fact that the parameter refers to part of a larger array is of no consequence.</p>
<p>If one is sure that the elements exist, it is also possible to index backwards in an array; <code>p[-1]</code>, <code>p[-2]</code>, and so on are syntactically legal, and refer to the elements that immediately precede <code>p[0]</code>. Of course, it is illegal to refer to objects that are not within the array bounds.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="address-arithmetic"><a class="header" href="#address-arithmetic">Address Arithmetic</a></h1>
<p>If <code>p</code> is a pointer to some element of an array, then <code>p++</code> increments <code>p</code> to point to the next element, and <code>p+=i</code> increments it to point <code>i</code> elements beyond where it currently does. These and similar constructions are the simplest forms of pointer or address arithmetic.</p>
<p>C is consistent and regular in its approach to address arithmetic; its integration of pointers, arrays, and address arithmetic is one of the strengths of the language. Let us illustrate by writing a rudimentary storage allocator. There are two routines. The first, <code>alloc(n)</code>, returns a pointer to <code>n</code> consecutive character positions, which can be used by the caller of <code>alloc</code> for storing characters. The second, <code>afree(p)</code>, releases the storage thus acquired so it can be reused later. The routines are "rudimentary" because the calls to <code>afree</code> must be made in the opposite order to the calls made on <code>alloc</code>. That is, the storage managed by <code>alloc</code> and <code>afree</code> is a stack, or last-in, first-out. The standard library provides analogous functions called <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> that have no such restrictions; in <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter8/8-0.html">Section 8.7</a> we will show how they can be implemented.</p>
<p>The easiest implementation is to have <code>alloc</code> hand out pieces of a large character array that we will call <code>allocbuf</code>. This array is private to <code>alloc</code> and <code>afree</code>. Since they deal in pointers, not array indices, no other routine need know the name of the array, which can be declared <code>static</code> in the source file containing <code>alloc</code> and <code>afree</code>, and thus be invisible outside it. In practical implementations, the array may well not even have a name; it might instead be obtained by calling <code>malloc</code> or by asking the operating system for a pointer to some unnamed block of storage.</p>
<p>The other information needed is how much of <code>allocbuf</code> has been used. We use a pointer, called <code>allocp</code>, that points to the next free element. When <code>alloc</code> is asked for <code>n</code> characters, it checks to see if there is enough room left in <code>allocbuf</code>. If so, <code>alloc</code> returns the current value of <code>allocp</code> (i.e., the beginning of the free block), then increments it by <code>n</code> to point to the next free area. If there is no room, <code>alloc</code> returns zero. <code>afree(p)</code> merely sets <code>allocp</code> to <code>p</code> if <code>p</code> is inside <code>allocbuf</code>.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-4%20Address%20Arithmetic.png" alt="" /></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define ALLOCSIZE 10000 /* size of available space */

static char allocbuf[ALLOCSIZE]; /* storage for alloc */
static char *allocp = allocbuf; /* next free position */

char *alloc(int n) /* return pointer to n characters */
{
    if (allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE - allocp &gt;= n) { /* it fits */
        allocp += n;
        return allocp - n; /* old p */
    } else { /* not enough room */
        return 0;
    }
}

void afree(char *p) /* free storage pointed to by p */
{
    if (p &gt;= allocbuf &amp;&amp; p &lt; allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE) {
        allocp = p;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In general a pointer can be initialized just as any other variable can, though normally the only meaningful values are zero or an expression involving the address of previously defined data of appropriate type. The declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static char *allocp = allocbuf;
</code></pre>
<p>defines <code>allocp</code> to be a character pointer and initializes it to point to the beginning of allocbuf, which is the next free position when the program starts. This could also have been written</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static char *allocp = &amp;allocbuf[0];
</code></pre>
<p>since the array name <em>is</em> the address of the zeroth element.</p>
<p>The test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE - allocp &gt;= n) {} /* it fits */
</code></pre>
<p>checks if there's enough room to satisfy a request for n characters. If there is, the new value of <code>allocp</code> would be at most one beyond the end of <code>allocbuf</code>. If the request can be satisfied, <code>alloc</code> returns a pointer to the beginning of a block of characters (notice the declaration of the function itself). If not, alloc must return some signal that there is no space left. C guarantees that zero is never a valid address for data, so a return value of zero can be used to signal an abnormal event, in this case no space.</p>
<p>Pointers and integers are not interchangeable. Zero is the sole exception: the constant zero may be assigned to a pointer, and a pointer may be compared with the constant zero. The symbolic constant <code>NULL</code> is often used in place of zero, as a mnemonic to indicate more clearly that this is a special value for a pointer. <code>NULL</code> is defined in <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>. We will use <code>NULL</code> henceforth.</p>
<p>Tests like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE - allocp &gt;= n) {} /* it fits */
</code></pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (p &gt;= allocbuf &amp;&amp; p &lt; allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE)
</code></pre>
<p>show several important facets of pointer arithmetic. First, pointers may be compared under certain circumstances. If <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> point to members of the same array, then relations like <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, etc., work properly. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">p &lt; q
</code></pre>
<p>is true if <code>p</code> points to an earlier element of the array than <code>q</code> does. Any pointer can be meaningfully compared for equality or inequality with zero. But the behavior is undefined for arithmetic or comparisons with pointers that do not point to members of the same array. (There is one exception: the address of the first element past the end of an array can be used in pointer arithmetic.)</p>
<p>Second, we have already observed that a pointer and an integer may be added or subtracted. The construction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">p + n
</code></pre>
<p>means the address of the n-th object beyond the one <code>p</code> currently points to. This is true regardless of the kind of object <code>p</code> points to; <code>n</code> is scaled according to the size of the objects <code>p</code> points to, which is determined by the declaration of <code>p</code>. If an <code>int</code> is four bytes, for example, the int will be scaled by four.</p>
<p>Pointer subtraction is also valid: if <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> point to elements of the same array, and <code>p&lt;q</code>, then <code>q-p+1</code> is the number of elements from <code>p</code> to <code>q</code> inclusive. This fact can be used to write yet another version of <code>strlen</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strlen: return length of string s */
int strlen(char *s)
{
    char *p = s;
    while (*p != '\0')
        p++;
    return p - s;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In its declaration, <code>p</code> is initialized to <code>s</code>, that is, to point to the first character of the string. In the <code>while</code> loop, each character in turn is examined until the <code>'\0'</code> at the end is seen. Because <code>p</code> points to characters, <code>p++</code> advances p to the next character each time, and <code>p-s</code> gives the number of characters advanced over, that is, the string length. (The number of characters in the string could be too large to store in an <code>int</code>). The header <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code> defines a type <code>ptrdiff_t</code> that is large enough to hold the signed difference of two pointer values. If we were being cautious, however, we would use <code>size_t</code> for the return value of <code>strlen</code>, to match the standard library version. <code>size_t</code> is the unsigned integer type returned by the <code>sizeof</code> operator.</p>
<p>Pointer arithmetic is consistent: if we had been dealing with floats, which occupy more storage that chars, and if <code>p</code> were a pointer to <code>float</code>, <code>p++</code> would advance to the next <code>float</code>. Thus we could write another version of <code>alloc</code> that maintains floats instead of chars, merely by changing <code>char</code> to <code>float</code> throughout <code>alloc</code> and <code>afree</code>. All the pointer manipulations automatically take into account the size of the objects pointed to.</p>
<p>The valid pointer operations are assignment of pointers of the same type, adding or subtracting a pointer and an integer, subtracting or comparing two pointers to members of the same array, and assigning or comparing to zero. <em>All other pointer arithmetic is illegal</em>. It is not legal to add two pointers, or to multiply or divide or shift or mask them, or to add <code>float</code> or <code>double</code> to them, or even, except for <code>void *</code>, to assign a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type without a cast.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="character-pointers-and-functions"><a class="header" href="#character-pointers-and-functions">Character Pointers and Functions</a></h1>
<p>A <em>string constant</em>, written as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">"I am a string"
</code></pre>
<p>is an array of characters. In the internal representation, the array is terminated with the null character <code>'\0'</code> so that programs can find the end. The length in storage is thus one more than the number of characters between the double quotes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most common occurrence of string constants is as arguments to functions, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("hello, world\n");
</code></pre>
<p>When a character string like this appears in a program, access to it is through a character pointer; <code>printf</code> receives a pointer to the beginning of the character array. That is, a string constant is accessed by a pointer to its first element.</p>
<p>String constants need not be function arguments. If <code>pmessage</code> is declared as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *pmessage;
</code></pre>
<p>then the statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">pmessage = "now is the time";
</code></pre>
<p>assigns to <code>pmessage</code> a pointer to the character array. This is <em>not</em> a string copy; only pointers are involved. C does not provide any operators for processing an entire string of characters as a unit.</p>
<p>There is an important difference between these definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char amessage[] = "now is the time"; /* an array */
char *pmessage = "now is the time"; /* a pointer */
</code></pre>
<p><code>amessage</code> is an <code>array</code>, just big enough to hold the sequence of characters and <code>'\0'</code> that terminates it. Individual characters within the array may be changed but <code>amessage</code> will always refer to the same storage. On the other hand, <code>pmessage</code> is a <code>pointer</code>, initialized to point to a string constant; the pointer may subsequently be modified to point elsewhere, but the result is undefined if you try to modify the string contents.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-5%20Character%20Pointers%20and%20Functions.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We will illustrate more aspects of pointers and arrays by studying versions of two useful functions adapted from the standard library. The first function is <code>strcpy(s,t)</code>, which copies the string <code>t</code> to the string <code>s</code>. It would be nice just to say <code>s=t</code> but this copies the pointer, not the characters. To copy the characters, we need a loop. The array version first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strcpy: copy t to s; array subscript version */
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
   int i;
   i = 0;
   while ((s[i] = t[i]) != '\0')
       i++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>For contrast, here is a version of <code>strcpy</code> with pointers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strcpy: copy t to s; pointer version */
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
   int i;
   i = 0;
   while ((*s = *t) != '\0') {
       s++;
       t++;
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because arguments are passed by value, <code>strcpy</code> can use the parameters <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> in any way it pleases. Here they are conveniently initialized pointers, which are marched along the arrays a character at a time, until the <code>'\0'</code> that terminates <code>t</code> has been copied into <code>s</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>strcpy</code> would not be written as we showed it above. Experienced C programmers would prefer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strcpy: copy t to s; pointer version 2 */
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
   while ((*s++ = *t++) != '\0')
       ;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This moves the increment of <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> into the test part of the loop. The value of <code>*t++</code> is the character that <code>t</code> pointed to before <code>t</code> was incremented; the postfix <code>++</code> doesn't change <code>t</code> until after this character has been fetched. In the same way, the character is stored into the old <code>s</code> position before <code>s</code> is incremented. This character is also the value that is compared against <code>'\0'</code> to control the loop. The net effect is that characters are copied from <code>t</code> to <code>s</code>, up to and including the terminating <code>'\0'</code>.</p>
<p>As the final abbreviation, observe that a comparison against <code>'\0'</code> is redundant, since the question is merely whether the expression is zero. So the function would likely be written as</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strcpy: copy t to s; pointer version 3 */
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
    while (*s++ = *t++)
        ;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Although this may seem cryptic at first sight, the notational convenience is considerable, and the idiom should be mastered, because you will see it frequently in C programs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em></p>
<p>A bit of nuance regarding the abbreviation of notation as described above.
One of the most important parts of writing code, is writing <em>readable</em> code.
And sure, the above notation is definitely readable, but performance-wise there is no gain compared to the earlier (and much easier to understand) versions that used a more verbose notation.</p>
<p>As stated before, compilers are <em>incredibly</em> advanced, and can optimize your code immensely. There is no reason to manually optimize what the compiler can handle just as well or better. Write code <em>you</em> and anyone else who has to read your code can understand.</p>
<p>Of course, optimizations can be made, and you definitely <em>should</em> make them. But only if they truly matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>strcpy</code> in the standard library (<code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>) returns the target string as its function value.</p>
<p>The second routine that we will examine is <code>strcmp(s,t)</code>, which compares the character strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, and returns negative, zero or positive if <code>s</code> is lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than <code>t</code>. The value is obtained by subtracting the characters at the first position where <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> disagree.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strcmp: return &lt;0 if s&lt;t, 0 if s==t, &gt;0 if s&gt;t */
int strcmp(char *s, char *t)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; s[i] == t[i]; i++)
        if (s[i] == '\0')
            return 0;
    return s[i] - t[i];
}
</code></pre>
<p>The pointer version of <code>strcmp</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* strcmp: return &lt;0 if s&lt;t, 0 if s==t, &gt;0 if s&gt;t */
int strcmp(char *s, char *t)
{
    for ( ; *s == *t; s++, t++)
        if (*s == '\0')
            return 0;
    return *s - *t;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> are either prefix or postfix operators, other combinations of <code>*</code> and <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>
occur, although less frequently. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*--p
</code></pre>
<p>decrements <code>p</code> before fetching the character that <code>p</code> points to. In fact, the pair of expressions</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*p++ = val; /* push val onto stack */
val = *--p; /* pop top of stack into val */
</code></pre>
<p>are the standard idiom for pushing and popping a stack; see <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter4/4-3.html">Section 4.3</a>.</p>

<p>Since pointers are variables themselves, they can be stored in arrays just as other variables can. Let us illustrate by writing a program that will sort a set of text lines into alphabetic order, a stripped-down version of the UNIX program <code>sort</code>.</p>
<p>In <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter3/3-0.html">Chapter 3</a>, we presented a Shell sort function that would sort an array of integers, and in <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a> we improved on it with a quicksort. The same algorithms will work, except that now we have to deal with lines of text, which are of different lengths, and which, unlike integers, can't be compared or moved in a single operation. We need a data representation that will cope efficiently and conveniently with variable-length text lines.</p>
<p>This is where the array of pointers enters. If the lines to be sorted are stored end-to-end in one long character array, then each line can be accessed by a pointer to its first character. The pointers themselves can be stored in an array. Two lines can be compared by passing their pointers to <code>strcmp</code>. When two out-of-order lines have to be exchanged, the pointers in the pointer array are exchanged, not the text lines themselves.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-6%20Pointer%20Arrays;%20Pointers%20to%20Pointers.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This eliminates the twin problems of complicated storage management and high overhead that would go with moving the lines themselves.</p>
<p>The sorting process has three steps:</p>
<pre><code>read all the lines of input
sort them
print them in order
</code></pre>
<p>As usual, it's best to divide the program into functions that match this natural division, with the main routine controlling the other functions. Let us defer the sorting step for a moment, and concentrate on the data structure and the input and output.</p>
<p>The input routine has to collect and save the characters of each line, and build an array of pointers to the lines. It will also have to count the number of input lines, since that information is needed for sorting and printing. Since the input function can only cope with a finite number of input lines, it can return some illegal count like -1 if too much input is presented.</p>
<p>The output routine only has to print the lines in the order in which they appear in the array of pointers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; nlines; i++)
        printf("%s\n", lineptr[i]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>getline</code> is from <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter1/1-9.html">Section 1.9</a>.</p>
<p>The main new thing is the declaration for <code>lineptr</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *lineptr[MAXLINES]
</code></pre>
<p>says that <code>lineptr</code> is an array of <code>MAXLINES</code> elements, each element of which is a pointer to a <code>char</code>. That is, <code>lineptr[i]</code> is a character pointer, and <code>*lineptr[i]</code> is the character it points to, the first character of the i-th saved text line.</p>
<p>Since <code>lineptr</code> is itself the name of an array, it can be treated as a pointer in the same manner as in our earlier examples, and <code>writelines</code> can be written instead as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* writelines: write output lines */
void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines)
{
    while (nlines-- &gt; 0)
        printf("%s\n", *lineptr++);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Initially, <code>*lineptr</code> points to the first line; each element advances it to the next line pointer while <code>nlines</code> is counted down.</p>
<p>With input and output under control, we can proceed to sorting. The quicksort from <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a> needs minor changes: the declarations have to be modified, and the comparison operation must be done by calling <code>strcmp</code>. The algorithm remains the same, which gives us some confidence that it will still work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* qsort: sort v[left]...v[right] into increasing order */
void qsort(char *v[], int left, int right)
{
    int i, last;
    void swap(char *v[], int i, int j);
    if (left &gt;= right) /* do nothing if array contains */
        return; /* fewer than two elements */
    swap(v, left, (left + right)/2);
    last = left;
    for (i = left+1; i &lt;= right; i++)
        if (strcmp(v[i], v[left]) &lt; 0)
            swap(v, ++last, i);
    swap(v, left, last);
    qsort(v, left, last-1);
    qsort(v, last+1, right);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the <code>swap</code> routine needs only trivial changes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* swap: interchange v[i] and v[j] */
void swap(char *v[], int i, int j)
{
    char *temp;
    temp = v[i];
    v[i] = v[j];
    v[j] = temp;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since any individual element of <code>v</code> (alias <code>lineptr</code>) is a character pointer, <code>temp</code> must be also, so one can be copied to the other.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">month_day(1988, 60, &amp;m, &amp;d)
</code></pre>
<p>sets m to 2 and d to 29 (February 29th).</p>
<p>These functions both need the same information, a table of the number of days in each month ("thirty days hath September ..."). Since the number of days per month differs for leap years and non-leap years, it's easier to separate them into two rows of a two-dimensional array than to keep track of what happens to February during computation. The array and the functions for performing the transformations are as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static char daytab[2][13] = {
    {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31},
    {0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}
};

/* day_of_year: set day of year from month &amp; day */
int day_of_year(int year, int month, int day)
{
    int i, leap;
    leap = year%4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year%100 != 0 || year%400 == 0;
    for (i = 1; i &lt; month; i++)
        day += daytab[leap][i];
    return day;
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* month_day: set month, day from day of year */
void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday)
{
    int i, leap;
    leap = year%4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year%100 != 0 || year%400 == 0;
    for (i = 1; yearday &gt; daytab[leap][i]; i++)
        yearday -= daytab[leap][i];
    *pmonth = i;
    *pday = yearday;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Recall that the arithmetic value of a logical expression, such as the one for leap, is either zero (false) or one (true), so it can be used as a subscript of the array <code>daytab</code>.</p>
<p>The array <code>daytab</code> has to be external to both <code>day_of_year</code> and <code>month_day</code>, so they can both use it. We made it <code>char</code> to illustrate a legitimate use of <code>char</code> for storing small non-character integers.</p>
<p><code>daytab</code> is the first two-dimensional array we have dealt with. In C, a two-dimensional array is really a one-dimensional array, each of whose elements is an array. Hence subscripts are written as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">daytab[i][j] /* [row][col] */
</code></pre>
<p>rather than:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">daytab[i,j] /* WRONG */
</code></pre>
<p>Other than this notational distinction, a two-dimensional array can be treated in much the same way as in other languages. Elements are stored by rows, so the rightmost subscript, or column, varies fastest as elements are accessed in storage order.</p>
<p>An array is initialized by a list of initializers in braces; each row of a two-dimensional array is initialized by a corresponding sub-list. We started the array <code>daytab</code> with a column of zero so that month numbers can run from the natural 1 to 12 instead of 0 to 11. Since space is not at a premium here, this is clearer than adjusting the indices.</p>
<p>If a two-dimensional array is to be passed to a function, the parameter declaration in the function must include the number of columns; the number of rows is irrelevant, since what is passed is, as before, a pointer to an array of rows, where each row is an array of 13 ints. In this particular case, it is a pointer to objects that are arrays of 13 ints. Thus if the array <code>daytab</code> is to be passed to a function <code>f</code>, the declaration of <code>f</code> would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">f(int daytab[2][13]) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>It could also be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">f(int daytab[][13]) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>since the number of rows is irrelevant, or it could be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">f(int (*daytab)[13]) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>which says that the parameter is a pointer to an array of 13 integers. The parentheses are necessary since brackets <code>[]</code> have higher precedence than <code>*</code>. Without parentheses, the declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int *daytab[13]
</code></pre>
<p>is an array of 13 pointers to integers. More generally, only the first dimension (subscript) of an array is free; all the others have to be specified.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter5/../Chapter5/5-12.html">Section 5.12</a> has a further discussion of complicated declarations.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter5/../Solutions/Chapter5/E5-8.html"><strong>Exercise 5-8.</strong></a> There is no error checking in <code>day_of_year</code> or <code>month_day</code>. Remedy this defect.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="initialization-of-pointer-arrays"><a class="header" href="#initialization-of-pointer-arrays">Initialization of Pointer Arrays</a></h1>
<p>Consider the problem of writing a function <code>month_name(n)</code>, which returns a pointer to a character string containing the name of the n-th month. This is an ideal application for an internal static array. <code>month_name</code> contains a private array of character strings, and returns a pointer to the proper one when called. This section shows how that array of names is initialized.</p>
<p>The syntax is similar to previous initializations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* month_name: return name of n-th month */
char *month_name(int n)
{
    static char *name[] = {
        "Illegal month",
        "January", "February", "March",
        "April", "May", "June",
        "July", "August", "September",
        "October", "November", "December"
    };
    return (n &lt; 1 || n &gt; 12) ? name[0] : name[n];
}
</code></pre>
<p>The declaration of name, which is an array of character pointers, is the same as <code>lineptr</code> in the sorting example. The initializer is a list of character strings; each is assigned to the corresponding position in the array. The characters of the i-th string are placed somewhere, and a pointer to them is stored in <code>name[i]</code>. Since the size of the array name is not specified, the compiler counts the initializers and fills in the correct number.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pointers-vs-multi-dimensional-arrays"><a class="header" href="#pointers-vs-multi-dimensional-arrays">Pointers vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays</a></h1>
<p>Newcomers to C are sometimes confused about the difference between a two-dimensional array and an array of pointers, such as name in the example above. Given the definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int a[10][20];
int *b[10];
</code></pre>
<p>then <code>a[3][4]</code> and <code>b[3][4]</code> are both syntactically legal references to a single <code>int</code>. But <code>a</code> is a true two-dimensional array: 200 int-sized locations have been set aside, and the conventional rectangular subscript calculation <code>20 * row + col</code> is used to find the element <code>a[row,col]</code>. For <code>b</code>, however, the definition only allocates 10 pointers and does not initialize them; initialization must be done explicitly, either statically or with code. Assuming that each element of <code>b</code> does point to a twenty-element array, then there will be 200 ints set aside, plus ten cells for the pointers. The important advantage of the pointer array is that the rows of the array may be of different lengths. That is, each element of <code>b</code> need not point to a twenty-element vector; some may point to two elements, some to fifty, and some to none at all.</p>
<p>Although we have phrased this discussion in terms of integers, by far the most frequent use of arrays of pointers is to store character strings of diverse lengths, as in the function <code>month_name</code>. Compare the declaration and picture for an array of pointers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *name[] = { "Illegal month", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" };
</code></pre>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-9%20Pointers%20vs%20Multidimensional%20Arrays%2001.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>with those for a two-dimensional array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char aname[][15] = { "Illegal month", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" };
</code></pre>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-9%20Pointers%20vs%20Multidimensional%20Arrays%2002.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="Chapter5/../Solutions/Chapter5/E5-9.html"><strong>Exercise 5-9.</strong></a> Rewrite the routines day_of_year and month_day with pointers instead of indexing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="command-line-arguments"><a class="header" href="#command-line-arguments">Command-line Arguments</a></h1>
<p>In environments that support C, there is a way to pass command-line arguments or parameters to a program when it begins executing. When <code>main</code> is called, it is called with two arguments. The first (conventionally called <code>argc</code>, for argument count) is the number of command-line arguments the program was invoked with; the second (<code>argv</code>, for argument vector) is a pointer to an array of character strings that contain the arguments, one per string. We customarily use multiple levels of pointers to manipulate these character strings.</p>
<p>The simplest illustration is the program <code>echo</code>, which echoes its command-line arguments on a single line, separated by blanks. That is, the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">echo hello, world
</code></pre>
<p>prints the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">hello, world
</code></pre>
<p>By convention, <code>argv[0]</code> is the name by which the program was invoked, so <code>argc</code> is at least 1. If <code>argc</code> is 1, there are no command-line arguments after the program name. In the example above, <code>argc</code> is 3, and <code>argv[0]</code>, <code>argv[1]</code>, and <code>argv[2]</code> are "echo", "hello,", and "world" respectively. The first optional argument is <code>argv[1]</code> and the last is <code>argv[argc-1]</code>; additionally, the standard requires that <code>argv[argc]</code> be a null pointer.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-10%20Command-line%20Arguments.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The first version of <code>echo</code> treats <code>argv</code> as an array of character pointers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
/* echo command-line arguments; 1st version */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int i;
    for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++)
        printf("%s%s", argv[i], (i &lt; argc-1) ? " " : "");
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>argv</code> is a pointer to an array of pointers, we can manipulate the pointer rather than index the array. This next variant is based on incrementing <code>argv</code>, which is a pointer to pointer to char, while <code>argc</code> is counted down:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
/* echo command-line arguments; 2nd version */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    while (--argc &gt; 0)
        printf("%s%s", *++argv, (argc &gt; 1) ? " " : "");
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>argv</code> is a pointer to the beginning of the array of argument strings, incrementing it by 1 (<code>++argv</code>) makes it point at the original <code>argv[1]</code> instead of <code>argv[0]</code>. Each successive increment moves it along to the next argument; <code>*argv</code> is then the pointer to that argument. At the same time, <code>argc</code> is decremented; when it becomes zero, there are no arguments left to print.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could write the <code>printf</code> statement as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf((argc &gt; 1) ? "%s " : "%s", *++argv);
</code></pre>
<p>This shows that the format argument of <code>printf</code> can be an expression too.
As a second example, let us make some enhancements to the pattern-finding program from <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter4/4-1.html">Section 4.1</a>. If you recall, we wired the search pattern deep into the program, an obviously unsatisfactory arrangement. Following the lead of the UNIX program <code>grep</code>, let us enhance the program so the pattern to be matched is specified by the first argument on the command line.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#define MAXLINE 1000
int getline(char *line, int max);
/* find: print lines that match pattern from 1st arg */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char line[MAXLINE];
    int found = 0;
    if (argc != 2)
        printf("Usage: find pattern\n");
    else
        while (getline(line, MAXLINE) &gt; 0)
            if (strstr(line, argv[1]) != NULL) {
                printf("%s", line);
                found++;
            }
    return found;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The standard library function <code>strstr(s,t)</code> returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the string <code>t</code> in the string <code>s</code>, or NULL if there is none. It is declared in <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The model can now be elaborated to illustrate further pointer constructions. Suppose we want to allow two optional arguments. One says "print all the lines <em>except</em> those that match the pattern;" the second says "precede each printed line by its line number."</p>
<p>A common convention for C programs on UNIX systems is that an argument that begins with a minus sign introduces an optional flag or parameter. If we choose <code>-x</code> (for "except") to signal the inversion, and <code>-n</code> ("number") to request line numbering, then the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">find -x -n*pattern*
</code></pre>
<p>will print each line that doesn't match the pattern, preceded by its line number.</p>
<p>Optional arguments should be permitted in any order, and the rest of the program should be independent of the number of arguments that we present. Furthermore, it is convenient for users if option arguments can be combined, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">find -nx pattern
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#define MAXLINE 1000
int getline(char *line, int max);
/* find: print lines that match pattern from 1st arg */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char line[MAXLINE];
    long lineno = 0;
    int c, except = 0, number = 0, found = 0;
    while (--argc &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (*++argv)[0] == '-')
        while (c = *++argv[0])
            switch (c) {
                case 'x':
                    except = 1;
                    break;
                case 'n':
                    number = 1;
                    break;
                default:
                    printf("find: illegal option %c\n", c);
                    argc = 0;
                    found = -1;
                    break;
            }
    if (argc != 1)
        printf("Usage: find -x -n pattern\n");
    else
        while (getline(line, MAXLINE) &gt; 0) {
            lineno++;
            if ((strstr(line, *argv) != NULL) != except) {
                if (number)
                    printf("%ld:", lineno);
                printf("%s", line);
                found++;
            }
        }
    return found;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>argc</code> is decremented and <code>argv</code> is incremented before each optional argument. At the end of the loop, if there are no errors, <code>argc</code> tells how many arguments remain unprocessed and <code>argv</code> points to the first of these. Thus <code>argc</code> should be 1 and <code>*argv</code> should point at the pattern. Notice that <code>*++argv</code> is a pointer to an argument string, so <code>(*++argv)[0]</code> is its first character. (An alternate valid form would be <code>**++argv</code>.) Because <code>[]</code> binds tighter than <code>*</code> and <code>++</code>, the parentheses are necessary; without them the expression would be taken as <code>*++(argv[0])</code>. In fact, that is what we have used in the inner loop, where the task is to walk along a specific argument string. In the inner loop, the expression <code>*++argv[0]</code> increments the pointer <code>argv[0]</code>!</p>
<p>It is rare that one uses pointer expressions more complicated than these; in such cases, breaking them into two or three steps will be more intuitive.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pointers-to-functions"><a class="header" href="#pointers-to-functions">Pointers to Functions</a></h1>
<p>In C, a function itself is not a variable, but it is possible to define pointers to functions, which can be assigned, placed in arrays, passed to functions, returned by functions, and so on. We will illustrate this by modifying the sorting procedure written earlier in this chapter so that if the optional argument <code>-n</code> is given, it will sort the input lines numerically instead of lexicographically.</p>
<p>A sort often consists of three parts - a comparison that determines the ordering of any pair of objects, an exchange that reverses their order, and a sorting algorithm that makes comparisons and exchanges until the objects are in order. The sorting algorithm is independent of the comparison and exchange operations, so by passing different comparison and exchange functions to it, we can arrange to sort by different criteria. This is the approach taken in our new sort.</p>
<p>Lexicographic comparison of two lines is done by <code>strcmp</code>, as before; we will also need a routine <code>numcmp</code> that compares two lines on the basis of numeric value and returns the same kind of condition indication as <code>strcmp</code> does. These functions are declared ahead of <code>main</code> and a pointer to the appropriate one is passed to <code>qsort</code>. We have skimped on error processing for arguments, so as to concentrate on the main issues.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#define MAXLINES 5000 /* max #lines to be sorted */
char *lineptr[MAXLINES]; /* pointers to text lines */

int readlines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);
void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);
void qsort(void *lineptr[], int left, int right, int (*comp)(void *, void *));
int numcmp(char *, char *);

/* sort input lines */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int nlines; /* number of input lines read */
    int numeric = 0; /* 1 if numeric sort */

    if (argc &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; strcmp(argv[1], "-n") == 0)
        numeric = 1;

    if ((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) &gt;= 0) {
        qsort((void**) lineptr, 0, nlines-1, (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));
        writelines(lineptr, nlines);
        return 0;
    } else {
        printf("input too big to sort\n");
        return 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the call to <code>qsort</code>, <code>strcmp</code> and <code>numcmp</code> are addresses of functions. Since they are known to be functions, the <code>&amp;</code> is not necessary, in the same way that it is not needed before an array name.</p>
<p>We have written <code>qsort</code> so it can process any data type, not just character strings. As indicated by the function prototype, <code>qsort</code> expects an array of pointers, two integers, and a function with two pointer arguments. The generic pointer type <code>void *</code> is used for the pointer arguments. Any pointer can be cast to <code>void *</code> and back again without loss of information, so we can call <code>qsort</code> by casting arguments to <code>void *</code>. The elaborate cast of the function argument casts the arguments of the comparison function. These will generally have no effect on actual representation, but assure the compiler that all is well.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* qsort: sort v[left]...v[right] into increasing order */
void qsort(void *v[], int left, int right,
           int (*comp)(void *, void *))
{
    int i, last;
    void swap(void *v[], int, int);
    if (left &gt;= right) /* do nothing if array contains */
        return; /* fewer than two elements */
    swap(v, left, (left + right)/2);
    last = left;
    for (i = left+1; i &lt;= right; i++)
        if ((*comp)(v[i], v[left]) &lt; 0)
            swap(v, ++last, i);
    swap(v, left, last);
    qsort(v, left, last-1, comp);
    qsort(v, last+1, right, comp);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The declarations should be studied with some care. The fourth parameter of <code>qsort</code> is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int (*comp)(void *, void *)
</code></pre>
<p>which says that comp is a pointer to a function that has two <code>void *</code> arguments and returns an int.</p>
<p>The use of comp in the line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if ((*comp)(v[i], v[left]) &lt; 0)
</code></pre>
<p>is consistent with the declaration: comp is a pointer to a function, <code>*comp</code> is the function, and:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">(*comp)(v[i], v[left])
</code></pre>
<p>is the call to it. The parentheses are needed so the components are correctly associated; without them,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int *comp(void *, void *) /* WRONG */
</code></pre>
<p>says that comp is a function returning a pointer to an int, which is very different. We have already shown <code>strcmp</code>, which compares two strings. Here is <code>numcmp</code>, which compares two strings on a leading numeric value, computed by calling <code>atof</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
/* numcmp: compare s1 and s2 numerically */
int numcmp(char *s1, char *s2)
{
    double v1, v2;
    v1 = atof(s1);
    v2 = atof(s2);
    if (v1 &lt; v2)
        return -1;
    else if (v1 &gt; v2)
        return 1;
    else
        return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>swap</code> function, which exchanges two pointers, is identical to what we presented earlier in the chapter, except that the declarations are changed to <code>void *</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void swap(void *v[], int i, int j)
{
    void *temp;
    temp = v[i];
    v[i] = v[j];
    v[j] = temp;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A variety of other options can be added to the sorting program; some make challenging exercises.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter5/../Solutions/Chapter5/E5-14.html"><strong>Exercise 5-14.</strong></a> Modify the sort program to handle a <code>-r</code> flag, which indicates sorting in reverse (decreasing) order. Be sure that <code>-r</code> works with <code>-n</code>.</p>

<p>C is sometimes castigated for the syntax of its declarations, particularly ones that involve pointers to functions. The syntax is an attempt to make the declaration and the use agree; it works well for simple cases, but it can be confusing for the harder ones, because declarations cannot be read left to right, and because parentheses are over-used. The difference between:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int *f(); /* f: function returning pointer to int */
</code></pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int (*pf)(); /* pf: pointer to function returning int */
</code></pre>
<p>illustrates the problem: <code>*</code> is a prefix operator and it has lower precedence than <code>()</code>, so parentheses are necessary to force the proper association.</p>
<p>Although truly complicated declarations rarely arise in practice, it is important to know how to understand them, and, if necessary, how to create them. One good way to synthesize declarations is in small steps with <code>typedef</code>, which is discussed in <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter6/6-7.html">Section 6.7</a>. As an alternative, in this section we will present a pair of programs that convert from valid C to a word description and back again. The word description reads left to right.</p>
<p>The first, <code>dcl</code>, is the more complex. It converts a C declaration into a word description, as in these examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char **argv
    argv: pointer to char
int (*daytab)[13]
    daytab: pointer to array[13] of int
int *daytab[13]
    daytab: array[13] of pointer to int
void *comp()
    comp: function returning pointer to void
void (*comp)()
    comp: pointer to function returning void
char (*(*x())[])()
    x: function returning pointer to array[] of pointer to function returning char
char (*(*x[3])())[5]
    x: array[3] of pointer to function returning pointer to array[5] of char
</code></pre>
<p><code>dcl</code> is based on the grammar that specifies a declarator, which is spelled out precisely in <a href="Chapter5/../AppendixA/A8-5.html">Appendix A, Section 8.5</a>; this is a simplified form:</p>
<pre><code>dcl: optional *'s direct-dcl
direct-dcl name
        (dcl)
        direct-dcl()
        direct-dcl[optional size]
</code></pre>
<p>In words, a <em>dcl</em> is a <em>direct-dcl</em>, perhaps preceded by *'s. A <em>direct-dcl</em> is a name, or a parenthesized <em>dcl</em>, or a <em>direct-dcl</em> followed by parentheses, or a <em>direct-dcl</em> followed by brackets with an optional size.</p>
<p>This grammar can be used to parse functions. For instance, consider this declarator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">(*pfa[])()
</code></pre>
<p><em>pfa</em> will be identified as a <em>name</em> and thus as a <em>direct-dcl</em>. Then <code>pfa[]</code> is also a <em>direct-dcl</em>. Then <code>*pfa[]</code> is recognized as a <em>dcl</em>, so <code>(*pfa[])</code> is a <em>direct-dcl</em>. Then <code>(*pfa[])()</code> is a <em>direct-dcl</em> and thus a <em>dcl</em>. We can also illustrate the parse with a tree like this (where <em>direct-dcl</em> has been abbreviated to <em>dir-dcl</em>):</p>
<p><img src="Chapter5/../Images/5-12%20Complicated%20Declarations.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The heart of the <code>dcl</code> program is a pair of functions, <code>dcl</code> and <code>dirdcl</code>, that parse a declaration according to this grammar. Because the grammar is recursively defined, the functions call each other recursively as they recognize pieces of a declaration; the program is called a recursive-descent parser.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* dcl: parse a declarator */
void dcl(void)
{
    int ns;
    for (ns = 0; gettoken() == '*'; ) /* count *'s */
        ns++;
    dirdcl();
    while (ns-- &gt; 0)
        strcat(out, " pointer to");
}

/* dirdcl: parse a direct declarator */
void dirdcl(void)
{
    int type;
    if (tokentype == '(') { /* ( dcl ) */
        dcl();
        if (tokentype != ')')
            printf("error: missing )\n");
    } else if (tokentype == NAME) /* variable name */
        strcpy(name, token);
    else
        printf("error: expected name or (dcl)\n");
    while ((type = gettoken()) == PARENS || type == BRACKETS)
        if (type == PARENS)
            strcat(out, " function returning");
        else {
            strcat(out, " array");
            strcat(out, token);
            strcat(out, " of");
        }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since the programs are intended to be illustrative, not bullet-proof, there are significant restrictions on <code>dcl</code>. It can only handle a simple data type line char or int. It does not handle argument types in functions, or qualifiers like const. Spurious blanks confuse it. It doesn't do much error recovery, so invalid declarations will also confuse it. These improvements are left as exercises.</p>
<p>Here are the global variables and the main routine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;
#define MAXTOKEN 100
enum { NAME, PARENS, BRACKETS };

void dcl(void);
void dirdcl(void);
int gettoken(void);

int tokentype;            /* type of last token */
char token[MAXTOKEN];     /* last token string */
char name[MAXTOKEN];      /* identifier name */
char datatype[MAXTOKEN];  /* data type = char, int, etc. */
char out[1000];

int main() /* convert declaration to words */
{
    while (gettoken() != EOF) { /* 1st token on line */
        strcpy(datatype, token); /* is the datatype */
        out[0] = '\0';
        dcl(); /* parse rest of line */
        if (tokentype != '\n')
            printf("syntax error\n");
        printf("%s: %s %s\n", name, out, datatype);
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>gettoken</code> skips blanks and tabs, then finds the next token in the input; a "token" is a name, a pair of parentheses, a pair of brackets perhaps including a number, or any other single character.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int gettoken(void) /* return next token */
{
    int c, getch(void);
    void ungetch(int);
    char *p = token;
    while ((c = getch()) == ' ' || c == '\t')
        ;
    if (c == '(') {
        if ((c = getch()) == ')') {
            strcpy(token, "()");
            return tokentype = PARENS;
        } else {
            ungetch(c);
            return tokentype = '(';
        }
    } else if (c == '[') {
        for (*p++ = c; (*p++ = getch()) != ']'; )
            ;
        *p = '\0';
        return tokentype = BRACKETS;
    } else if (isalpha(c)) {
        for (*p++ = c; isalnum(c = getch()); )
            *p++ = c;
        *p = '\0';
        ungetch(c);
        return tokentype = NAME;
    } else
        return tokentype = c;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code> are discussed in <a href="Chapter5/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p>Going in the other direction is easier, especially if we do not worry about generating redundant parentheses. The program <code>undcl</code> converts a word description like "x is a function returning a pointer to an array of pointers to functions returning char", which we will express as</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">x () * [] * () char 
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char (*(*x())[])()
</code></pre>
<p>The abbreviated input syntax lets us reuse the <code>gettoken</code> function. <code>undcl</code> also uses the same external variables as <code>dcl</code> does.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* undcl: convert word descriptions to declarations */
main()
{
    int type;
    char temp[MAXTOKEN];

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-6---structures"><a class="header" href="#chapter-6---structures">Chapter 6 - Structures</a></h1>
<p>A structure is a collection of one or more variables, possibly of different types, grouped together under a single name for convenient handling. (Structures are called "records" in some languages, notably Pascal.) Structures help to organize complicated data, particularly in large programs, because they permit a group of related variables to be treated as a unit instead of as separate entities.</p>
<p>One traditional example of a structure is the payroll record: an employee is described by a set of attributes such as name, address, social security number, salary, etc. Some of these in turn could be structures: a name has several components, as does an address and even a salary. Another example, more typical for C, comes from graphics: a point is a pair of coordinates, a rectangle is a pair of points, and so on.</p>
<p>The main change made by the ANSI standard is to define structure assignment - structures may be copied and assigned to, passed to functions, and returned by functions. This has been supported by most compilers for many years, but the properties are now precisely defined. Automatic structures and arrays may now also be initialized.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basics-of-structures"><a class="header" href="#basics-of-structures">Basics of Structures</a></h1>
<p>Let us create a few structures suitable for graphics. The basic object is a point, which we will assume has an <em>x</em> coordinate and a <em>y</em> coordinate, both integers.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter6/../Images/6-1%20Basics%20Of%20Structures%2001.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The two components can be placed in a structure declared like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
</code></pre>
<p>The keyword <code>struct</code> introduces a structure declaration, which is a list of declarations enclosed in braces. An optional name called a <em>structure tag</em> may follow the word struct (as with point here). The tag names this kind of structure, and can be used subsequently as a shorthand for the part of the declaration in braces.</p>
<p>The variables named in a structure are called <em>members</em>. A structure member or tag and an ordinary (i.e., non-member) variable can have the same name without conflict, since they can always be distinguished by context. Furthermore, the same member names may occur in different structures, although as a matter of style one would normally use the same names only for closely related objects.</p>
<p>A struct declaration defines a type. The right brace that terminates the list of members may be followed by a list of variables, just as for any basic type. That is,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct { ... } x, y, z;
</code></pre>
<p>is syntactically analogous to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int x, y, z;
</code></pre>
<p>in the sense that each statement declares x, y and z to be variables of the named type and causes space to be set aside for them.</p>
<p>A structure declaration that is not followed by a list of variables reserves no storage; it merely describes a template or shape of a structure. If the declaration is tagged, however, the tag can be used later in definitions of instances of the structure. For example, given the declaration of point above,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct point pt;
</code></pre>
<p>defines a variable <em>pt</em> which is a structure of type <code>struct point</code>. A structure can be initialized by following its definition with a list of initializers, each a constant expression, for the members:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct maxpt = { 320, 200 };
</code></pre>
<p>An automatic structure may also be initialized by assignment or by calling a function that returns a structure of the right type.</p>
<p>A member of a particular structure is referred to in an expression by a construction of the form</p>
<pre><code>structure-name.member
</code></pre>
<p>The structure member operator <code>.</code> connects the structure name and the member name. To print the coordinates of the point <em>pt</em>, for instance,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("%d,%d", pt.x, pt.y);
</code></pre>
<p>or to compute the distance from the origin (0,0) to pt,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">double dist, sqrt(double);

dist = sqrt((double)pt.x * pt.x + (double)pt.y * pt.y);
</code></pre>
<p>Structures can be nested. One representation of a rectangle is a pair of points that denote the diagonally opposite corners:</p>
<p><img src="Chapter6/../Images/6-1%20Basics%20Of%20Structures%2002.png" alt="" /></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct rect {
    struct point pt1;
    struct point pt2;
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rect</code> structure contains two <code>point</code> structures. If we declare screen as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct rect screen;
</code></pre>
<p>then</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">screen.pt1.x
</code></pre>
<p>refers to the <em>x</em> coordinate of the pt1 member of screen.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="structures-and-functions"><a class="header" href="#structures-and-functions">Structures and Functions</a></h1>
<p>The only legal operations on a structure are copying it or assigning to it as a unit, taking its address with <code>&amp;</code>, and accessing its members. Copy and assignment include passing arguments to functions and returning values from functions as well. Structures may <em>not</em> be compared. A structure may be initialized by a list of constant member values; an automatic structure may also be initialized by an assignment.</p>
<p>Let us investigate structures by writing some functions to manipulate points and rectangles. There are at least three possible approaches: pass components separately, pass an entire structure, or pass a pointer to it. Each has its good points and bad points.</p>
<p>The first function, <code>makepoint</code>, will take two integers and return a point structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* makepoint: make a point from x and y components */
struct point makepoint(int x, int y)
{
    struct point temp;
    temp.x = x;
    temp.y = y;
    return temp;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that there is no conflict between the argument name and the member with the same name; indeed the re-use of the names stresses the relationship.</p>
<p><code>makepoint</code> can now be used to initialize any structure dynamically, or to provide structure arguments to a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct rect screen;
struct point middle;
struct point makepoint(int, int);

screen.pt1 = makepoint(0, 0);
screen.pt2 = makepoint(XMAX, YMAX);
middle = makepoint((screen.pt1.x + screen.pt2.x) / 2,
                   (screen.pt1.y + screen.pt2.y) / 2);
</code></pre>
<p>The next step is a set of functions to do arithmetic on points. For instance,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* addpoints: add two points */
struct point addpoint(struct point p1, struct point p2)
{
    p1.x += p2.x;
    p1.y += p2.y;
    return p1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here both the arguments and the return value are structures. We incremented the components in p1 rather than using an explicit temporary variable to emphasize that structure parameters are passed by value like any others.</p>
<p>As another example, the function <code>ptinrect</code> tests whether a point is inside a rectangle, where we have adopted the convention that a rectangle includes its left and bottom sides but not its top and right sides:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* ptinrect: return 1 if p in r, 0 if not */
int ptinrect(struct point p, struct rect r)
{
    return p.x &gt;= r.pt1.x &amp;&amp; p.x &lt; r.pt2.x
        &amp;&amp; p.y &gt;= r.pt1.y &amp;&amp; p.y &lt; r.pt2.y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This assumes that the rectangle is presented in a standard form where the pt1 coordinates are less than the pt2 coordinates. The following function returns a rectangle guaranteed to be in canonical form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define min(a, b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (a) : (b))
#define max(a, b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))

/* canonrect: canonicalize coordinates of rectangle */
struct rect canonrect(struct rect r)
{
    struct rect temp;
    temp.pt1.x = min(r.pt1.x, r.pt2.x);
    temp.pt1.y = min(r.pt1.y, r.pt2.y);
    temp.pt2.x = max(r.pt1.x, r.pt2.x);
    temp.pt2.y = max(r.pt1.y, r.pt2.y);
    return temp;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If a large structure is to be passed to a function, it is generally more efficient to pass a pointer than to copy the whole structure. Structure pointers are just like pointers to ordinary variables. The declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct point *pp;
</code></pre>
<p>says that <code>pp</code> is a pointer to a structure of type <code>struct point</code>. If <code>pp</code> points to a point structure, <code>*pp</code> is the structure, and <code>(*pp).x</code> and <code>(*pp).y</code> are the members. To use <code>pp</code>, we might write, for example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct point origin, *pp;
pp = &amp;origin;
printf("origin is (%d,%d)\n", (*pp).x, (*pp).y);
</code></pre>
<p>The parentheses are necessary in <code>(*pp).x</code> because the precedence of the structure member operator <code>.</code> is higher then <code>*</code>. The expression <code>*pp.x</code> means <code>*(pp.x)</code>, which is illegal here because x is not a pointer.</p>
<p>Pointers to structures are so frequently used that an alternative notation is provided as a shorthand. If p is a pointer to a structure, then</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">p-&gt;member-of-structure
</code></pre>
<p>refers to the particular member. So we could write instead</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">printf("origin is (%d,%d)\n", pp-&gt;x, pp-&gt;y); 
</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>.</code> and <code>-&gt;</code> associate from left to right, so if we have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct rect r, *rp = &amp;r; 
</code></pre>
<p>then these four expressions are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">r.pt1.x
rp-&gt;pt1.x
(r.pt1).x
(rp-&gt;pt1).x
</code></pre>
<p>The structure operators <code>.</code> and <code>-&gt;</code>, together with <code>()</code> for function calls and <code>[]</code> for subscripts, are at the top of the precedence hierarchy and thus bind very tightly. For example, given the declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct {
    int len;
    char *str;
} *p;
</code></pre>
<p>then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">++p-&gt;len
</code></pre>
<p>increments <code>len</code>, not <code>p</code>, because the implied parenthesization is <code>++(p-&gt;len)</code>. Parentheses can be used to alter binding: <code>(++p)-&gt;len</code> increments p before accessing len, and <code>(p++)-&gt;len</code> increments p afterward. (This last set of parentheses is unnecessary.)</p>
<p>In the same way, <code>*p-&gt;str</code> fetches whatever <code>str</code> points to; <code>*p-&gt;str++</code> increments <code>str</code> after accessing whatever it points to (just like <code>*s++</code>); <code>(*p-&gt;str)++</code> increments whatever <code>str</code> points to; and <code>*p++-&gt;str</code> increments p after accessing whatever <code>str</code> points to.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="arrays-of-structures"><a class="header" href="#arrays-of-structures">Arrays of Structures</a></h1>
<p>Consider writing a program to count the occurrences of each C keyword. We need an array of character strings to hold the names, and an array of integers for the counts. One possibility is to use two parallel arrays, keyword and keycount, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *keyword[NKEYS];
int keycount[NKEYS];
</code></pre>
<p>But the very fact that the arrays are parallel suggests a different organization, an array of structures. Each keyword is a pair:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *word;
int count;
</code></pre>
<p>and there is an array of pairs. The structure declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
} keytab[NKEYS];
</code></pre>
<p>declares a structure type <code>key</code>, defines an array <code>keytab</code> of structures of this type, and sets aside storage for them. Each element of the array is a structure. This could also be written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
};

struct key keytab[NKEYS];
</code></pre>
<p>Since the structure <code>keytab</code> contains a constant set of names, it is easiest to make it an external variable and initialize it once and for all when it is defined. The structure initialization is analogous to earlier ones - the definition is followed by a list of initializers enclosed in braces:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
} keytab[] = {
    "auto", 0,
    "break", 0,
    "case", 0,
    "char", 0,
    "const", 0,
    "continue", 0,
    "default", 0,
    /* ... */
    "unsigned", 0,
    "void", 0,
    "volatile", 0,
    "while", 0
};
</code></pre>
<p>The initializers are listed in pairs corresponding to the structure members. It would be more precise to enclose the initializers for each "row" or structure in braces, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">{ "auto", 0 },
{ "break", 0 },
{ "case", 0 },
...
</code></pre>
<p>but inner braces are not necessary when the initializers are simple variables or character strings, and when all are present. As usual, the number of entries in the array <code>keytab</code> will be computed if the initializers are present and the <code>[]</code> is left empty.</p>
<p>The keyword counting program begins with the definition of <code>keytab</code>. The <code>main</code> routine reads the input by repeatedly calling a function <code>getword</code> that fetches one word at a time. Each word is looked up in <code>keytab</code> with a version of the binary search function that we wrote in <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter3/3-0.html">Chapter 3</a>. The list of keywords must be sorted in increasing order in the table.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

                keytab[n].count++;
    for (n = 0; n &lt; NKEYS; n++)
        if (keytab[n].count &gt; 0)
            printf("%4d %s\n", keytab[n].count, keytab[n].word);

<p>We will show the function <code>getword</code> in a moment; for now it suffices to say that each call to <code>getword</code> finds a word, which is copied into the array named as its first argument.</p>
<p>The quantity <code>NKEYS</code> is the number of keywords in <code>keytab</code>. Although we could count this by hand, it's a lot easier and safer to do it by machine, especially if the list is subject to change. One possibility would be to terminate the list of initializers with a null pointer, then loop along <code>keytab</code> until the end is found.</p>
<p>But this is more than is needed, since the size of the array is completely determined at compile time. The size of the array is the size of one entry times the number of entries, so the number of entries is just:</p>
<pre><code>*size of* keytab / *size of* struct key
</code></pre>
<p>C provides a compile-time unary operator called <code>sizeof</code> that can be used to compute the size of any object. The expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">sizeof object
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">sizeof(type name)
</code></pre>
<p>yield an integer equal to the size of the specified object or type in bytes. (Strictly, <code>sizeof</code> produces an unsigned integer value whose type, <code>size_t</code>, is defined in the header <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code>.) An object can be a variable or array or structure. A type name can be the name of a basic type like int or double, or a derived type like a structure or a pointer.</p>
<p>In our case, the number of keywords is the size of the array divided by the size of one element. This computation is used in a <code>#define</code> statement to set the value of <code>NKEYS</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define NKEYS (sizeof keytab / sizeof(struct key))
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to write this is to divide the array size by the size of a specific element:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define NKEYS (sizeof keytab / sizeof(keytab[0]))
</code></pre>
<p>This has the advantage that it does not need to be changed if the type changes.
A <code>sizeof</code> can not be used in a <code>#if</code> line, because the preprocessor does not parse type names. But the expression in the <code>#define</code> is not evaluated by the preprocessor, so the code here is legal.</p>
<p>Now for the function <code>getword</code>. We have written a more general <code>getword</code> than is necessary for this program, but it is not complicated. <code>getword</code> fetches the next "word" from the input, where a word is either a string of letters and digits beginning with a letter, or a single nonwhite space character. The function value is the first character of the word, or EOF for end of file, or the character itself if it is not alphabetic.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* getword: get next word or character from input */
int getword(char *word, int lim)
{
    int c, getch(void);
    void ungetch(int);
    char *w = word;
    while (isspace(c = getch()))
        ;
    if (c != EOF)
        *w++ = c;
    if (!isalpha(c)) {
        *w = '\0';
        return c;
    }
    for ( ; --lim &gt; 0; w++)
        if (!isalnum(*w = getch())) {
            ungetch(*w);
            break;
        }
    *w = '\0';
    return word[0];
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>getword</code> uses the <code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code> that we wrote in <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter4/4-0.html">Chapter 4</a>. When the collection of an alphanumeric token stops, <code>getword</code> has gone one character too far. The call to <code>ungetch</code> pushes that character back on the input for the next call. <code>getword</code> also uses <code>isspace</code> to skip whitespace, <code>isalpha</code> to identify letters, and <code>isalnum</code> to identify letters and digits; all are from the standard header <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><a href="Chapter6/../Solutions/Chapter6/E6-1.html"><strong>Exercise 6-1.</strong></a> Our version of <code>getword</code> does not properly handle underscores, string constants, comments, or preprocessor control lines. Write a better version.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pointers-to-structures"><a class="header" href="#pointers-to-structures">Pointers to Structures</a></h1>
<p>To illustrate some of the considerations involved with pointers to - and arrays of - structures, let us write the keyword-counting program again, this time using pointers instead of array indices.</p>
<p>The external declaration of <code>keytab</code> need not change, but <code>main</code> and <code>binsearch</code> do need modification.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#define MAXWORD 100

int getword(char *, int);
struct key *binsearch(char *, struct key *, int);

/* count C keywords; pointer version */
main() {
    char word[MAXWORD];
    struct key *p;

    while (getword(word, MAXWORD) != EOF)
        if (isalpha(word[0]))
            if ((p = binsearch(word, keytab, NKEYS)) != NULL)
                p-&gt;count++;

    for (p = keytab; p &lt; keytab + NKEYS; p++)
        if (p-&gt;count &gt; 0)
            printf("%4d %s\n", p-&gt;count, p-&gt;word);

    return 0;
}

/* binsearch: find word in tab[0]...tab[n-1] */
struct key *binsearch(char *word, struct key *tab, int n) {
    int cond;
    struct key *low = &amp;tab[0];
    struct key *high = &amp;tab[n];
    struct key *mid;

    while (low &lt; high) {
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if ((cond = strcmp(word, mid-&gt;word)) &lt; 0)
            high = mid;
        else if (cond &gt; 0)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            return mid;
    }
    return NULL;
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are several things worthy of note here. First, the declaration of <code>binsearch</code> must indicate that it returns a pointer to <code>struct key</code> instead of an integer; this is declared both in the function prototype and in <code>binsearch</code>. If <code>binsearch</code> finds the word, it returns a pointer to it; if it fails, it returns NULL.</p>
<p>Second, the elements of <code>keytab</code> are now accessed by pointers. This requires significant changes in <code>binsearch</code>.</p>
<p>The initializers for low and high are now pointers to the beginning and just past the end of the table.</p>
<p>The computation of the middle element can no longer be simply</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">mid = (low+high) / 2; /* WRONG */
</code></pre>
<p>because the addition of pointers is illegal. Subtraction is legal, however, so <code>high-low</code> is the number of elements, and thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">mid = low + (high-low) / 2;
</code></pre>
<p>sets mid to the element halfway between low and high.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em></p>
<p>On this line: <code>mid = low + (high-low) / 2;</code> the reason it is allowed is because even though low is a pointer, the equation <code>(high-low)/2</code> results in an index, not a pointer.
So the result of that is a pointer + an index, which <em>is</em> allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important change is to adjust the algorithm to make sure that it does not generate an illegal pointer or attempt to access an element outside the array. The problem is that <code>&amp;tab[- 1]</code> and <code>&amp;tab[n]</code> are both outside the limits of the array tab. The former is strictly illegal, and it is illegal to dereference the latter. The language definition does guarantee, however, that pointer arithmetic that involves the first element beyond the end of an array (that is, <code>&amp;tab[n])</code> will work correctly).</p>
<p>In main we wrote:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (p = keytab; p &lt; keytab + NKEYS; p++)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>p</code> is a pointer to a structure, arithmetic on <code>p</code> takes into account the size of the structure, so
<code>p++</code> increments <code>p</code> by the correct amount to get the next element of the array of structures, and
the test stops the loop at the right time.</p>
<p>Don't assume, however, that the size of a structure is the sum of the sizes of its members. Because of alignment requirements for different objects, there may be unnamed "holes" in a structure. Thus, for instance, if a <code>char</code> is one byte and an <code>int</code> four bytes, the structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct {
    char c;
    int i;
};
</code></pre>
<p>might well require eight bytes, not five. The <code>sizeof</code> operator returns the proper value.</p>
<p>Finally, an aside on program format: when a function returns a complicated type like a structure pointer, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct key *binsearch(char *word, struct key \*tab, int n)
</code></pre>
<p>the function name can be hard to see, and to find with a text editor. Accordingly an alternate style is sometimes used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct key *
binsearch(char *word, struct key *tab, int n)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a matter of personal taste; pick the form you like and hold to it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="self-referential-structures"><a class="header" href="#self-referential-structures">Self-referential Structures</a></h1>
<p>Suppose we want to handle the more general problem of counting the occurrences of <em>all</em> the words in some input. Since the list of words isn't known in advance, we can't conveniently sort it and use a binary search. Yet we can't do a linear search for each word as it arrives, to see if it's already been seen; the program would take too long. (More precisely, its running time is likely to grow quadratically with the number of input words.) How can we organize the data to copy efficiently with a list or arbitrary words?</p>
<p>One solution is to keep the set of words seen so far sorted at all times, by placing each word into its proper position in the order as it arrives. This shouldn't be done by shifting words in a linear array, though - that also takes too long. Instead we will use a data structure called a <em>binary tree</em>.</p>
<p>The tree contains one "node" per distinct word; each node contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pointer to the text of the word,</li>
<li>A count of the number of occurrences,</li>
<li>A pointer to the left child node,</li>
<li>A pointer to the right child node.</li>
</ul>
<p>No node may have more than two children; it might have only zero or one.</p>
<p>The nodes are maintained so that at any node the left subtree contains only words that are lexicographically less than the word at the node, and the right subtree contains only words that are greater. This is the tree for the sentence "now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party", as built by inserting each word as it is encountered:</p>
<p><img src="Chapter6/../Images/6-5%20Self-referential%20Structures.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To find out whether a new word is already in the tree, start at the root and compare the new word to the word stored at that node. If they match, the question is answered affirmatively. If the new record is less than the tree word, continue searching at the left child, otherwise at the right child. If there is no child in the required direction, the new word is not in the tree, and in fact the empty slot is the proper place to add the new word. This process is recursive, since the search from any node uses a search from one of its children. Accordingly, recursive routines for insertion and printing will be most natural.</p>
<p>Going back to the description of a node, it is most conveniently represented as a structure with four components:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct tnode {           /* the tree node: */
    char *word;          /* points to the text */
    int count;           /* number of occurrences */
    struct tnode *left;  /* left child */
    struct tnode *right; /* right child */
};
</code></pre>
<p>This recursive declaration of a node might look chancy, but it's correct. <ins>It is illegal for a structure to contain an instance of itself</ins>, but:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct tnode *left;
</code></pre>
<p>declares <code>left</code> to be a <em>pointer</em> to a <code>tnode</code>, not a <code>tnode</code> itself.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one needs a variation of self-referential structures: two structures that refer to each other. The way to handle this is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct t {
    ...
    struct s *p; /* p points to an s */
};
struct s {
    ...
    struct t *q; /* q points to a t */
};
</code></pre>
<p>The code for the whole program is surprisingly small, given a handful of supporting routines like <code>getword</code> that we have already written. The <code>main</code> routine reads words with <code>getword</code> and installs them in the tree with <code>addtree</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#define MAXWORD 100

struct tnode *addtree(struct tnode *, char *);
void treeprint(struct tnode *);
int getword(char *, int);

/* word frequency count */
int main()
{
    struct tnode *root;
    char word[MAXWORD];

    root = NULL;
    while (getword(word, MAXWORD) != EOF)
        if (isalpha(word[0]))
            root = addtree(root, word);
    treeprint(root);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>addtree</code> is recursive. A word is presented by <code>main</code> to the top level (the root) of the tree. At each stage, that word is compared to the word already stored at the node, and is percolated down to either the left or right subtree by a recursive call to <code>addtree</code>. Eventually, the word either matches something already in the tree (in which case the count is incremented), or a null pointer is encountered, indicating that a node must be created and added to the tree. If a new node is created, <code>addtree</code> returns a pointer to it, which is installed in the parent node.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct tnode *talloc(void);
char *strdup(char *);

/* addtree: add a node with w, at or below p */
struct tnode *addtree(struct tnode *p, char *w)
{
    int cond;
    if (p == NULL) { /* a new word has arrived */
        p = talloc(); /* make a new node */
        p-&gt;word = strdup(w);
        p-&gt;count = 1;
        p-&gt;left = p-&gt;right = NULL;
    } else if ((cond = strcmp(w, p-&gt;word)) == 0)
        p-&gt;count++; /* repeated word */
    else if (cond &lt; 0) /* less than into left subtree */
        p-&gt;left = addtree(p-&gt;left, w);
    else /* greater than into right subtree */
        p-&gt;right = addtree(p-&gt;right, w);
    return p;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Storage for the new node is fetched by a routine <code>talloc</code>, which returns a pointer to a free space suitable for holding a tree node, and the new word is copied into a hidden space by <code>strdup</code>. (We will discuss these routines in a moment.) The count is initialized, and the two children are made null. This part of the code is executed only at the leaves of the tree, when a new node is being added. We have (unwisely) omitted error checking on the values returned by <code>strdup</code> and <code>talloc</code>.</p>
<p><code>treeprint</code> prints the tree in sorted order; at each node, it prints the left subtree (all the words less than this word), then the word itself, then the right subtree (all the words greater). If you feel shaky about how recursion works, simulate treeprint as it operates on the tree shown above.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* treeprint: in-order print of tree p */
void treeprint(struct tnode *p)
{
    if (p != NULL) {
        treeprint(p-&gt;left);
        printf("%4d %s\n", p-&gt;count, p-&gt;word);
        treeprint(p-&gt;right);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A practical note: if the tree becomes "unbalanced" because the words don't arrive in random order, the running time of the program can grow too much. As a worst case, if the words are already in order, this program does an expensive simulation of linear search. There are generalizations of the binary tree that do not suffer from this worst-case behavior, but we will not describe them here.</p>
<p>Before leaving this example, it is also worth a brief digression on a problem related to storage allocators. Clearly it's desirable that there be only one storage allocator in a program, even though it allocates different kinds of objects. But if one allocator is to process requests for, say, pointers to chars and pointers to struct tnodes, two questions arise. First, how does it meet the requirement of most real machines that objects of certain types must satisfy alignment restrictions (for example, integers often must be located at even addresses)? Second, what declarations can cope with the fact that an allocator must necessarily return different kinds of pointers?</p>
<p>Alignment requirements can generally be satisfied easily, at the cost of some wasted space, by ensuring that the allocator always returns a pointer that meets <em>all</em> alignment restrictions. The alloc of <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter5/5-0.html">Chapter 5</a> does not guarantee any particular alignment, so we will use the standard library function <code>malloc</code>, which does. In <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter8/8-0.html">Chapter 8</a> we will show one way to implement <code>malloc</code>.</p>
<p>The question of the type declaration for a function like <code>malloc</code> is a vexing one for any language that takes its type-checking seriously. In C, the proper method is to declare that <code>malloc</code> returns a pointer to void, then explicitly coerce the pointer into the desired type with a cast. <code>malloc</code> and related routines are declared in the standard header <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>. Thus <code>talloc</code> can be written as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
/* talloc: make a tnode */
struct tnode *talloc(void)
{
    return (struct tnode *) malloc(sizeof(struct tnode));
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>strdup</code> merely copies the string given by its argument into a safe place, obtained by a call on <code>malloc</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *strdup(char *s) /* make a duplicate of s */
{
    char *p;
    p = (char *) malloc(strlen(s) + 1); /* +1 for '\0' */
    if (p != NULL)
        strcpy(p, s);
    return p;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>malloc</code> returns NULL if no space is available; <code>strdup</code> passes that value on, leaving errorhandling to its caller.</p>
<p>Storage obtained by calling <code>malloc</code> may be freed for re-use by calling <code>free</code>; see <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter8/8-0.html">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter7/7-0.html">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="table-lookup"><a class="header" href="#table-lookup">Table Lookup</a></h1>
<p>In this section we will write the innards of a table-lookup package, to illustrate more aspects of structures. This code is typical of what might be found in the symbol table management routines of a macro processor or a compiler. For example, consider the <code>#define</code> statement. When a line like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define IN 1
</code></pre>
<p>is encountered, the name IN and the replacement text 1 are stored in a table. Later, when the name <code>IN</code> appears in a statement like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">state = IN;
</code></pre>
<p>it must be replaced by 1.</p>
<p>There are two routines that manipulate the names and replacement texts. <code>install(s,t)</code> records the name s and the replacement text t in a table; s and t are just character strings. <code>lookup(s)</code> searches for s in the table, and returns a pointer to the place where it was found, or NULL if it wasn't there.</p>
<p>The algorithm is a hash-search - the incoming name is converted into a small non-negative integer, which is then used to index into an array of pointers. An array element points to the beginning of a linked list of blocks describing names that have that hash value. It is NULL if no names have hashed to that value.</p>
<p><img src="Chapter6/../Images/6-6%20Tabel%20Lookup.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A block in the list is a structure containing pointers to the name, the replacement text, and the next block in the list. A null next-pointer marks the end of the list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct nlist { /* table entry: */
    struct nlist *next; /* next entry in chain */
    char *name; /* defined name */
    char *defn; /* replacement text */
};
</code></pre>
<p>The pointer array is just:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define HASHSIZE 101
static struct nlist *hashtab[HASHSIZE]; /* pointer table */
</code></pre>
<p>The hashing function, which is used by both lookup and install, adds each character value in the string to a scrambled combination of the previous ones and returns the remainder modulo the array size. This is not the best possible hash function, but it is short and effective.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* hash: form hash value for string s */
unsigned hash(char *s)
{
    unsigned hashval;
    for (hashval = 0; *s != '\0'; s++)
        hashval = *s + 31 * hashval;
    return hashval % HASHSIZE;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unsigned arithmetic ensures that the hash value is non-negative.</p>
<p>The hashing process produces a starting index in the array <code>hashtab</code>; if the string is to be found anywhere, it will be in the list of blocks beginning there. The search is performed by <code>lookup</code>. If <code>lookup</code> finds the entry already present, it returns a pointer to it; if not, it returns NULL.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* lookup: look for s in hashtab */
struct nlist *lookup(char *s)
{
    struct nlist *np;
    for (np = hashtab[hash(s)]; np != NULL; np = np-&gt;next)
        if (strcmp(s, np-&gt;name) == 0)
            return np; /* found */
    return NULL; /* not found */
}
</code></pre>
<p>The for loop in <code>lookup</code> is the standard idiom for walking along a linked list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">for (ptr = head; ptr != NULL; ptr = ptr-&gt;next)
    ...
</code></pre>
<p><code>install</code> uses <code>lookup</code> to determine whether the name being installed is already present; if so, the new definition will supersede the old one. Otherwise, a new entry is created. <code>install</code> returns NULL if for any reason there is no room for a new entry.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct nlist *lookup(char *);
char *strdup(char *);

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="typedef"><a class="header" href="#typedef">Typedef</a></h1>
<p>C provides a facility called <code>typedef</code> for creating new data type names. For example, the declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">typedef int Length;
</code></pre>
<p>makes the name <code>Length</code> a synonym for int. The type <code>Length</code> can be used in declarations, casts, etc., in exactly the same ways that the int type can be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">Length len, maxlen;
Length *lengths[];
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">typedef char *String;
</code></pre>
<p>makes <code>String</code> a synonym for <code>char *</code> or character pointer, which may then be used in declarations and casts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">String p, lineptr[MAXLINES], alloc(int);
int strcmp(String, String);
p = (String) malloc(100);
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the type being declared in a typedef appears in the position of a variable name, not right after the word <code>typedef</code>. Syntactically, <code>typedef</code> is like the storage classes <code>extern</code>, <code>static</code>, etc. We have used capitalized names for typedefs, to make them stand out.</p>
<p>As a more complicated example, we could make typedefs for the tree nodes shown earlier in this chapter:</p>

} Treenode;

<p>This creates two new type keywords called <code>Treenode</code> (a structure) and <code>Treeptr</code> (a pointer to the structure). Then the routine <code>talloc</code> could become</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">Treeptr talloc(void)
{
    return (Treeptr) malloc(sizeof(Treenode));
}
</code></pre>
<p>It must be emphasized that a typedef declaration does not create a new type in any sense; it merely adds a new name for some existing type. Nor are there any new semantics: variables declared this way have exactly the same properties as variables whose declarations are spelled out explicitly. In effect, <code>typedef</code> is like <code>#define</code>, except that since it is interpreted by the compiler, it can cope with textual substitutions that are beyond the capabilities of the preprocessor. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">typedef int (*PFI)(char *, char *);
</code></pre>
<p>creates the type <code>PFI</code>, for "pointer to function (of two char * arguments) returning int",
which can be used in contexts like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">PFI strcmp, numcmp; 
</code></pre>
<p>in the sort program of <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter5/5-0.html">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p>Besides purely aesthetic issues, there are two main reasons for using typedefs. The first is to parameterize a program against portability problems. If typedefs are used for data types that may be machine-dependent, only the typedefs need change when the program is moved. One common situation is to use typedef names for various integer quantities, then make an appropriate set of choices of short, int, and long for each host machine. Types like <code>size_t</code> and <code>ptrdiff_t</code> from the standard library are examples.</p>
<p>The second purpose of typedefs is to provide better documentation for a program - a type called <code>Treeptr</code> may be easier to understand than one declared only as a pointer to a complicated structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em></p>
<p>I might be appealing to use typedef for almost everything - "why not give everything a unique name?" - The reality is that by doing so you are obfuscating the true meaning behind the type.
If you want to read a nice opinion check out the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#typedefs">Linux Kernel Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Key takeaway: be mindful about when you use a typedef, often times primitive types say much more about a variable.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unions"><a class="header" href="#unions">Unions</a></h1>
<p>A <em>union</em> is a variable that may hold (at different times) objects of different types and sizes, with the compiler keeping track of size and alignment requirements. Unions provide a way to manipulate different kinds of data in a single area of storage, without embedding any machine-dependent information in the program. They are analogous to "variant records" in Pascal.</p>
<p>As an example such as might be found in a compiler symbol table manager, suppose that a constant may be an int, a float, or a character pointer. The value of a particular constant must be stored in a variable of the proper type, yet it is most convenient for table management if the value occupies the same amount of storage and is stored in the same place regardless of its type. This is the purpose of a union - a single variable that can legitimately hold any of one of several types. The syntax is based on structures:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">union u_tag {
    int ival;
    float fval;
    char *sval;
} u;
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>u</code> will be large enough to hold the largest of the three types; the specific size is implementation-dependent. Any of these types may be assigned to <code>u</code> and then used in expressions, so long as the usage is consistent: the type retrieved must be the type most recently stored. It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track of which type is currently stored in a union; the results are implementation-dependent if something is stored as one type and extracted as another.</p>
<p>Syntactically, members of a union are accessed as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*union-name*.*member*
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*union-pointer*-&gt;*member*
</code></pre>
<p>just as for structures.</p>
<p>If the variable <code>utype</code> is used to keep track of the current type stored in <code>u</code>, then one might see code such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (utype == INT)
    printf("%d\n", u.ival);
if (utype == FLOAT)
    printf("%f\n", u.fval);
if (utype == STRING)
    printf("%s\n", u.sval);
else
    printf("bad type %d in utype\n", utype);
</code></pre>
<p>Unions may occur within structures and arrays, and vice versa. The notation for accessing a member of a union in a structure (or vice versa) is identical to that for nested structures. For example, in the structure array defined by:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct {
    char *name;
    int flags;
    int utype;
    union {
        int ival;
        float fval;
        char *sval;
    } u;
} symtab[NSYM];
</code></pre>
<p>the member <code>ival</code> is referred to as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">symtab[i].u.ival
</code></pre>
<p>and the first character of the string <code>sval</code> by either of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">*symtab[i].u.sval

symtab[i].u.sval[0]
</code></pre>
<p>In effect, a union is a structure in which all members have offset zero from the base, the structure is big enough to hold the "widest" member, and the alignment is appropriate for all of the types in the union. The same operations are permitted on unions as on structures: assignment to or copying as a unit, taking the address, and accessing a member.</p>
<p><ins>A union may only be initialized with a value of the type of its first member</ins>; thus union <code>u</code> described above can only be initialized with an integer value.</p>
<p>The storage allocator in <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter8/8-0.html">Chapter 8</a> shows how a union can be used to force a variable to be aligned on a particular kind of storage boundary.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bit-fields"><a class="header" href="#bit-fields">Bit-fields</a></h1>
<p>When storage space is at a premium, it may be necessary to pack several objects into a single machine word; one common use is a set of single-bit flags in applications like compiler symbol tables. Externally-imposed data formats, such as interfaces to hardware devices, also often require the ability to get at pieces of a word.</p>
<p>Imagine a fragment of a compiler that manipulates a symbol table. Each identifier in a program has certain information associated with it, for example, whether or not it is a keyword, whether or not it is external and/or static, and so on. The most compact way to encode such information is a set of one-bit flags in a single char or int.</p>
<p>The usual way this is done is to define a set of "masks" corresponding to the relevant bit positions, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define KEYWORD  01
#define EXTRENAL 02
#define STATIC   04
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">enum { KEYWORD = 01, EXTERNAL = 02, STATIC = 04 };
</code></pre>
<p>The numbers must be powers of two. Then accessing the bits becomes a matter of "bitfiddling" with the shifting, masking, and complementing operators that were described in <a href="Chapter6/../Chapter2/2-0.html">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p>Certain idioms appear frequently:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">flags |= EXTERNAL | STATIC;
</code></pre>
<p>turns on the EXTERNAL and STATIC bits in flags, while:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">flags &amp;= ~(EXTERNAL | STATIC);
</code></pre>
<p>turns them off, and:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if ((flags &amp; (EXTERNAL | STATIC)) == 0)
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>is true if both bits are off.</p>
<p>Although these idioms are readily mastered, as an alternative C offers the capability of defining and accessing fields within a word directly rather than by bitwise logical operators. A <em>bit-field</em>, or <em>field</em> for short, is a set of adjacent bits within a single implementation-defined storage unit that we will call a "word". For example, the symbol table #defines above could be replaced by the definition of three fields:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct {
    unsigned int is_keyword : 1;
    unsigned int is_extern : 1;
    unsigned int is_static : 1;
 } flags;
</code></pre>
<p>This defines a variable table called <code>flags</code> that contains three 1-bit fields. The number following the colon represents the field width in bits. The fields are declared unsigned int to ensure that they are unsigned quantities.</p>
<p>Individual fields are referenced in the same way as other structure members: flags.is_keyword, flags.is_extern, etc. Fields behave like small integers, and may participate in arithmetic expressions just like other integers. Thus the previous examples may be written more naturally as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">flags.is_extern = flags.is_static = 1;
</code></pre>
<p>to turn the bits on;</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">flags.is_extern = flags.is_static = 0; 
</code></pre>
<p>to turn them off; and</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">if (flags.is_extern == 0 &amp;&amp; flags.is_static == 0)
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>to test them.</p>
<p>Almost everything about fields is implementation-dependent. Whether a field may overlap a word boundary is implementation-defined. Fields need not be names; unnamed fields (a colon and width only) are used for padding. The special width 0 may be used to force alignment at the next word boundary.</p>
<p>Fields are assigned left to right on some machines and right to left on others. This means that although fields are useful for maintaining internally-defined data structures, the question of which end comes first has to be carefully considered when picking apart externally-defined data; programs that depend on such things are not portable. Fields may be declared only as ints; for portability, specify signed or unsigned explicitly. <ins>They are not arrays and they do not have addresses, so the <code>&amp;</code> operator cannot be applied on them.</ins></p>
