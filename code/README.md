# The C Programming Language

This part contains all the code from the book, in neat (and compilable) .c files.
The goal was to verify all code mentioned in the book is *actually* runnable on modern hardware, and at the time of writing this (2025) i can say that is indeed the case.

There are 2 parts here, there is the code mentioned in the book itself, and the exercises you are challenged to write.

The exercises are basic implementations and serve as a guideline and sanity check for those attempting to write their own version. Important to note is that my version is absolutely ***not*** the only correct way to implement the exercise.

Good luck, and lots of fun!
