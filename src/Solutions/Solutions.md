# Solutions

What follows here are possible solutions to the exercises given throughout the book (97 total).
I hope it's obvious that these are <ins>not</ins> the best possible solutions. They are just implementations i wrote that satisfy the objectives given in the exercises. In the [code folder of the repo of this project](https://github.com/RoBr-01/C-Programming-Language/tree/main/code) you will find the `.c` files of these solutions, so no need to copy-paste. They should compile and run anywhere just fine, if not, be sure to file an issue or send me a corrected version.

I highly recommend trying out the exercises for yourself first, if you're stuck you can always come here for inspiration.
