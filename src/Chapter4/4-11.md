# The C Preprocessor

C provides certain language facilities by means of a preprocessor, which is conceptually a separate first step in compilation. The two most frequently used features are `#include`, to include the contents of a file during compilation, and `#define`, to replace a token by an arbitrary sequence of characters. Other features described in this section include conditional compilation and macros with arguments.
