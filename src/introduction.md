# Introduction

Hi!

Welcome to my process of learning C through the famous book "The C Programming Language".
As i am reading, i will be adapting the book into a more web-friendly format.

To undertake this task, i am using 

<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/" target="_blank"> mdBook</a>
(whose result you are reading at this very moment) and part of the conversion from the PDF of the book to Markdown was done using 
<a href="https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker" target="_blank"> Marker</a>.

At some point i might add a small intro to explain how to get started with C (basic text editor, compiler etc.). Since i feel like starting from the basics is never a bad idea. Using an IDE right at the start might be overkill for people who enjoy "intuitive learning".

Anyway, enjoy!
