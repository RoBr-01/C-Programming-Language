# Introduction
Hi! This is a little side project where i will re-document the famous "The C Programming Language" book while studying its contents.

It will be a work in progress, and at the end i will add the solutions for the challenges given in the book.

To undertake this task, i am using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (whose result you are reading at this very moment) and part of the conversion from the PDF of the book to Markdown is done using [Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker).

I know this seems like a lot of content, and it definitely is. So i suggest taking your time to understand what you read, pausing and exploring deeper where needed.

An important part of programming is balancing learning with doing. Spending all your time learning means you don't do or make anything. Spending all your time making means you might not progress in a meaningful way.
