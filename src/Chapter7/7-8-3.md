# Ungetc

The standard library provides a rather restricted version of the function `ungetch` that we wrote in [Chapter 4](../Chapter4/4-0.md); it is called `ungetc`.

```c
int ungetc(int c, FILE *fp)
```

pushes the character c back onto file fp, and returns either c, or EOF for an error. Only one character of pushback is guaranteed per file. `ungetc` may be used with any of the input functions like `scanf`, `getc`, or `getchar`.
