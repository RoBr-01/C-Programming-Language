# String Operations

We have already mentioned the string functions `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `strcmp`, found in `<string.h>`. In the following, s and t are `char *`'s, and c and n are `int`s.

| Function       | Description                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| strcat(s,t)    | concatenate t to end of s                                   |
| strncat(s,t,n) | concatenate n characters of t to end of s                   |
| strcmp(s,t)    | return negative, zero, or positive for s < t, s == t, s > t |
| strncmp(s,t,n) | same as strcmp but only in first n characters               |
| strcpy(s,t)    | copy t to s                                                 |
| strncpy(s,t,n) | copy at most n characters of t to s                         |
| strlen(s)      | return length of s                                          |
| strchr(s,c)    | return pointer to first c in s, or NULL if not present      |
| strrchr(s,c)   | return pointer to last c in s, or NULL if not present       |
