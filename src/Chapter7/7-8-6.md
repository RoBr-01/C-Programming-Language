# Mathematical Functions

There are more than twenty mathematical functions declared in `<math.h>`; here are some of the more frequently used. Each takes one or two double arguments and returns a double.

| Function    | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| sin(x)      | sine of x, x in radians                 |
| cos(x)      | cosine of x, x in radians               |
| atan2(y, x) | arctangent of y/x, in radians           |
| exp(x)      | exponential function of x, base e       |
| log(x)      | natural (base e) logarithm of x (x > 0) |
| log10(x)    | common (base 10) logarithm of x (x > 0) |
| pow(x, y)   | x raised to the power of y              |
| sqrt(x)     | square root of x (x > 0)                |
| fabs(x)     | absolute value of x                     |
