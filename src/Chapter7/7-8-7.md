# Random Number Generation

The function `rand()` computes a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range zero to RAND_MAX, which is defined in `<stdlib.h>`. One way to produce random floating-point numbers greater than or equal to zero but less than one is

```c
#define frand() ((double) rand() / (RAND_MAX+1.0))
```

(If your library already provides a function for floating-point random numbers, it is likely to have better statistical properties than this one.)

The function `srand(unsigned)` sets the seed for `rand`. The portable implementation of `rand` and `srand` suggested by the standard appears in [Section 2.7](../Chapter2/2-7.md).

[**Exercise 7-9.**](../Solutions/Chapter7/E7-9.md) Functions like `isupper` can be implemented to save space or to save time. Explore both possibilities.
