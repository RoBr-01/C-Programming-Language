# Storage Management

The functions `malloc` and `calloc` obtain blocks of memory dynamically.

```c
void *malloc(size_t n)
```

returns a pointer to n bytes of *uninitialized* storage, or NULL if the request cannot be satisfied.

```c
void *calloc(size_t n, size_t size)
```

returns a pointer to enough free space for an array of n objects of the specified size, or NULL if the request cannot be satisfied. <ins>The storage is initialized to zero</ins>.

The pointer returned by `malloc` or `calloc` has the proper alignment for the object in question, but it must be cast into the appropriate type, as in:

```c
int *ip;
ip = (int *) calloc(n, sizeof(int));
```

`free(p)` frees the space pointed to by p, where p was originally obtained by a call to `malloc` or `calloc`. There are no restrictions on the order in which space is freed, but it is a ghastly error to free something not obtained by calling `malloc` or `calloc`.

It is also an error to use something after it has been freed. A typical but incorrect piece of code is this loop that frees items from a list:

```c
for (p = head; p != NULL; p = p->next) /* WRONG */ 
    free(p);
```

The right way is to save whatever is needed before freeing:

```c
for (p = head; p != NULL; p = q) {
    q = p->next;
    free(p);
}
```

[Section 8.7](../Chapter8/8-7.md) shows the implementation of a storage allocator like `malloc`, in which allocated blocks may be freed in any order.
