# Goto and Labels

C provides the infinitely-abusable `goto` statement, and labels to branch to. Formally, the `goto` statement is *never* necessary, and in practice it is almost always easy to write code without it. We have not used `goto` in this book.

Nevertheless, there are a few situations where gotos may find a place. The most common is to abandon processing in some deeply nested structure, such as breaking out of two or more loops at once. The break statement cannot be used directly since it only exits from the innermost loop. Thus:

```c
    for ( ... ) 
        for ( ... ) { 
                ... 
            if (disaster) 
                goto error; 
        } 
    ... 
error: 
    /* clean up the mess */
```

This organization is handy if the error-handling code is non-trivial, and if errors can occur in several places.

A label has the same form as a variable name, and is followed by a colon. It can be attached to any statement in the same function as the `goto`. The scope of a label is the entire function.

As another example, consider the problem of determining whether two arrays a and b have an element in common. One possibility is:

```c
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        for (j = 0; j < m; j++) 
            if (a[i] == b[j]) 
                goto found; 
    /* didn't find any common element */ 
    ... 
found: 
    /* got one: a[i] == b[j] */ 
    ...
```

Code involving a `goto` can *always* be written without one, though perhaps at the price of some repeated tests or an extra variable. For example, the array search becomes:

```c
found = 0; 
for (i = 0; i < n && !found; i++) 
    for (j = 0; j < m && !found; j++) 
        if (a[i] == b[j]) 
            found = 1; 
if (found) 
    /* got one: a[i-1] == b[j-1] */ 
    ... 
else 
    /* didn't find any common element */ 
    ...
```

With a few exceptions like those cited here, code that relies on `goto` statements is generally harder to understand and to maintain than code without gotos. Although we are not dogmatic about the matter, it does seem that `goto` statements should be used rarely, if at all.

>The `goto`statement is a remnant of **Assembly**. In Assembly there is often a `jump` instruction, that allows you to *jump* to any part of your code.

>C provides structured control flow constructs like `for` and `while`, which allow us to achieve the same logic as `goto` in a clearer, more maintainable way as discussed in Chapter 3. These can, as mentioned above, achieve the exact same goal as a `goto`can. So there is no reason to use it. Additionally, using goto can obscure control flow, making debugging and maintenance harder.
